,unable open labs submit lab assignments
,durante el desarrollo del curso vas acercandote cada vez mas problemas reales con la ayuda de herramientas que se utilizar en el desarrollo de ml.
,te da el conocimiento basico va profundizando en los conceptos sin saturar la leccion.
,"las notebooks son muy agradables ayudan mucho practicar la teoria, cabe duda que es el mejor curso de ml con el que puedes comenzar."
,"even auditing it, learn wealth material videos."
,"fact, respects, access optional labs (you ""upgrade"", subscribe, gain access) motivates create linear regression code scratch."
,makes bit challenge helps work coding skills well.
,course content optional lab helpful student changing field industry field data science.
,content helpful easy understand.
,thank coursera team deep learning team provide kind learning platfrom biggner.
,firstly would like thank standford university granting financial aid supervised machine learning course excellent well oraganised weeks lectures taught clearly even assingments challenging well .
,"liked course, didactic many practical labs experiment understand math behind ml models, also learn basic programming implement using python."
,"clear approaches mathematical point view, allowed better understand, rather approaching ml point view, includes set unique often confusing terms."
,"me, course personal milestone, able understand mathematical roots machine learning time implementation without necessarily decorating libraries."
,clearly say one best machine learning course whole world .
,covers core concepts scratch love teaching style andrew sir.
,amazing coure well preparied videos supporting labs.
,highly recomended beginner want cover subject short period time.
,defines sophisticated subjects machine learning simplest way possible homework notebooks great.
,thank lot sir wonderful explanation.
,"comparing previous course offered you, one far better .thank sir"
,better previous machine learning course.
,concepts visualized optional labs superb strengthen concepts.
,want know machine learning actual must take course.
,course teaches machine learning scratch.
,"send last tasks,a solved problem correctly,but output ,can help fix problem"
,none html links documentation lead anywhere.
,distinct problem assignments reference help documentations.
,zip files load properly.
,"found go around this, useless without help files."
,teacher leapfrogs material teaching use class construct them.
,"supposed beginner level course, sense is, said however recommend it."
,"teacher leaves much out, self promotes book wrote..(which bought.. big waste money) tries rush material teaching enough subject mater allow limited functionality."
,"want take beginners level course truly learn c#, it."
,im glad coursera free week trial period waste money course.
,qualify statements say finished taking two courses coursera learning python rice university.
,necessary foundation work either taught provided functional link.
,looking coursera another course/specialization learn c# different provider.
,recommend same.
,anyone previous development experience course easy.
,also dr. positive person.
,lot's fun video quizzes :) thank you!
,professor taught way even beginners programming understand.
,1st 5 courses specialisation already know create characters move around using code.
,"encountered problem though, students use discussion forums get peer graded assignments graded share links forum."
,forum meant discussions course get assignments graded use personal purposes such.
,"due this, assignments graded (assignment 4 - shipbuilding 101 me)."
,would really appreciate coursera took option accessing sharable link solutions penalised use discussion forums purpose.
,"often give bad reviews, course falls flat."
,take problems fixed.
,"instructor knowledgeable, fails walk learner final assignments every week."
,lecture line knowledge expected final exercise auto grader weak.
,"dr. chuck python course model done, course falls short."
,dr. tim wants make money needs simplify neither beginning c# course beginning math course.
,really need trig calculus take class understand formulas requested.
,i'm pulling lose much money frustrate death.
,difficult bad way.
,"starting around week 3, can't complete assignment due lack knowledge/instruction."
,"dr, expects know things never seen heard before."
,definitely beginners like me.
,knew nothing unity sounded intimidating course gradually made confident beginner game development unity .
,also afraid process debugging unity professor explained process well like tutorials completely scripted like professor make errors corrects makes overall learning session natural.
,"leats know basic game development like keyboard mouse game controller input spawning , applying force , screen clamping thing advance courses cover."
,complete beginner especially good programmer would highly recommend course
,extremely informative intro course primary focus programming!
,i'm completely new unity taken intro programming c++ course.
,personally found course hard follow along sometimes highly recommend beginner scripting unity learn first.
,edit: i've finished course 1-2 weeks pretty proud programming i've learned!
,i'd probably bump rating 5 star haha.
,"little sad end product final project ""flashy"" per say, still much worth taking course!!"
,goes way fast absolute beginners.
,instructor assumes understand lot concepts without ever explaining focuses foundation concepts need know understand what's going on.
,class structure like this: 3 simple concepts assignment worth points uses simple concepts plus 5 complicated ones never explained.
,forums dead can't really get help understand concepts never explained.
,"someone never programmed, incredibly frustrating confusing."
,instructor sound monotonous.
,deplying zip files mentioned do?
,"until, user bravel marks complet choose environment known"
,there's bombardment terminologies beginner-friendly; specialisation/course feels like refresher rather tutorial
,expect all.
,"right amount ""challenging"" course instead learning materials instructor given pushed look sources order complete requirements look reliable sources really literally practice skills."
,hope finish course though luxury constantly renew payment whenever miss class expecting course expiration date regards subscription.
,unity code quickly become overwhelming dr. starts going codes implemented camera.
,i'd suggest reviewing codes afterwards since provide source.
,things wish dr. could gone detail think book.
,"bought book far, able find answers via sources."
,"though used program quite much before, i'm object-oriented programming, i'm old fashioned that... well, not, dr changed mind it!"
,"course well-structured, contains lot info, finally enjoy unity!"
,want learn unity coding - highly recommended!
,love dr t's sense humour.
,definitely want complete 5.
,great course beginner programming unity.
,little familiarity programming help though.
,dr. gives solid foundation program correctly.
,"course practical sense create full publishable game course, people want learn specifically ""game programming"" solid understanding course."
,really enjoyed lectures course.
,"lots hand-on projects, learned useful c# grammars unity editor engine usage."
,cannot wait take next course specialization.
,"however would recommend course people programming experience, c# basics part might little bit hard green hands."
,"love dr t's style teaching, though week three downfall could omplete activities anymore querions help resources non-existant so, let's see otehr classes go."
,"course amazing, funny amazing helpful even bought book cant thank mr mean dr enough course amazing helpful recommend enough ~ ali hatim"
,"till now, well explained!"
,permits learner goes tracking map.
,teacher tries inspire us lessons.

,"completed week 4 assignment nearly week early, i'm still waiting grade."
,"also, forums look active."
,"feeling many people taking course, much less activity forums since week 1 there's chance students early either dropped lost interest."
,"course means enough students peer review assignment, waiting around grade."
,"good lecturer love lecture inspiration good teaching, assignment push beyouind notch cover class... thks dr. t."
,"concepts abstract, watched videos several times actually understand them."
,"thanks, dr. t!"
,course good need updated new information
,beginners new programming choose course
,really good beginners programming
,learnt course
,outdated code/project examples
,topics clear :(
,course exams great
,useful getting started
,glad attained course!
,course informative
,helpful newbies
,simple good!
,"nice interesting course get started c# unity, although opinion last programming assignment remade make lot sense assigment requires step step guide implement last assignement course.i would say contents course don織t quite prepare las assignment, therefore kind takes away little bit achievement feeling completing course."
,"lectures concise point, good thing."
,"overall, nice, room improvement."
,"done yet successive courses, however, course alone pretty useless opinion."
,"goes fast important concepts c# programming unity, object oriented programming."
,think people new programming must result difficult.
,"however, concepts explained clear enough gives quick start someone wants approach unity fast."
,think deserve try evaluate suits one needs knowledge.
,course alright.
,introduction c#.
,teacher knows alot!
,also means end alot distracting dont really know language.
,mention showing something wrong first happens often leads learning wrong thing first.. takes much time work untraining information.
,"learned lot following course, would able get without husband help me."
,felt like big knowledge leaps made even though course supposed written/made absolute beginners.
,knowledge finishing however super useful start trying program games.
,"overall course decent job presenting programming principles simple way, sometimes simple."
,"feels like content purposely cut avoid ""scaring off"" learners."
,"assignments poorly explained, (as usual coursera) outdated, resulting considerable time wasted."
,course overall good better instructor help us explain prewritten codes video writing give reasons studying.
,means write code scratch show us prewritten code explain.
,little outdated since monodevelop completely deprecated current version unity well visual studio 2019 build instead 2017.
,course interesting information useful course projects compelling engaging.
,game projects excessively traditional.
,"bit basic, definitely teaches barebones unity c#."
,reccommended people little experience either.
,find course helpful.
,assignments seem ask info taught videos.
,analogy course this: like making newborn baby watch video swimming throwing ocean acting shocked know swim.
,mentors discussion forum condescending help understand terms using.
,"fun course, free textbook simply incredible."
,"slow pace, might good totally beginners know anything cs programming slow you."
,know bit programming language skills using c c++.
,"also wanted learn python programming language, decided go coursera & want say....waao...dr. chuck awesome, way taught pretty great... mean say that... course pretty awesome everyone want go python programming language so, i'm highly recommending go course."
,"two weeks sort nonsense, including macarena, harry potter, sorting hat, videos meaningless travels lots self-promotion."
,pure crap doesn織t worth anybody織s time.
,"theory started week 3 confusing, boring time life decided quit."
,shocked serious university like university michigan clown payroll.
,tried use class teach brown bag lunch employees interested programming.
,python great language class low content volume ratio (nobody wants watch instructor meet life-time idol trade-show watch intel versus amd melt-down commercials lunch break).
,tan solo auditar este curso ayud籀 bastante en el aprendizaje de este lenguage de programaci籀n.
,penas ahorre el dinero comprar矇 el resto de cursos para seguir adelante.
,gracias charles severance!
,"vague info, assignments even anything videos, videos helpful give examples."
,"terrible, extremely hard."
,"recommend course beginners, anyone fact."
,course dumbed much moderately intelligent person subjected it.
,coursera really needs rethink approach teaching.
,express sympathy seduced actually paying course.
,course bad!
,try ask help mentors reply cant help honor code.
,well tat sound like much honor code me.
,course work duh!
,need help.
,dont need help time time.
,think coursera needs lot improvement.
,extremely dissatisfied coursera course especially mentors lack mentoring.
,education uplifting positive area individuals ask question receive help scolded asking help asking questions like beat dog.
,mean really think coursera needs go take hints real school university seek information education best students teach ask help learn others give opportunity help whats point discussion board.
,away discussion board change way honor code written.
,yes agree honor work come on.
,help tutoring valuable part education necessary learning!
,please make necessary changes better coursera make positive educational experience.
,mean please trying best got one seems want help learn improve skills understanding.
,make changes make now.
,another reason hate course coursera believe people helping one another.
,mentors cant even explain work problem.
,menotrs make things stressful need dont give help hints clues.
,people need talk people phone person instructor needs give better examples people better figure things own.
,think coursera crap unpleaseant experience me.
,discussing board see others struggling things mentos dont help them.
,people pleading help receiving guidance direction help figure things out.
,things need change program.
,need change soon!
,nb: audited course get feedback assignments.
,"true beginner, programming computer experience whatsoever course you."
,dr. severance explains concepts well using great metaphors he's quite engaging.
,"however, takes incredibly long time uses many many words many mostly irrelevant videos."
,"coding experience all, might find better download python free book (which written engaging style using conceptual metaphors) go pace."

,spent 100 hours alone assignments.
,mentors supposed help help all.
,poorly put together second module prepare complete assignments
,"introduction nice, problem homework design."
,"homework cover much people learnt class, easy forget materials class."
,chuck still great lecturer.
,it? pleasure listen watch him.
,lucky chance.
,"but, *some grunting* first course hogwarts-like, second definitely azkaban-manner."
,"seems chuck kidnapped cozy study, devoid fave thermo-mug like, placed dark something."
,"even chuck became happy self, imho."
,azkaban-notes one see course n2.
,look paper-glass hands professor.
,tuples-week seemed read hasty manner.
,"14:46 even prof bit inaccurate, (chalked much stuff screen one two things)."
,week 7 showed us return lares penates exception imho proves rule.
,"one asks personal opinion, vote ?ogwarts?? study-lectures without cameramen tricks thermo-mug."
,hope future courses would great too.
,chuck rules!
,course excellent experience me.
,"opinion, dr. chuck creative brilliant teacher."
,"think teacher one difficult professions world, great online teacher even difficult."
,nevertheless dr chuck proved possible.
,"makes every student takes classes fall love python, want learn everything it."
,also gives us information tools need understand leccion make excersices course.
,"invents different ways motivate students, interviews famous people, meetings fellow students coursera."
,"i'm greatfull experience, thanks coursera thanks dr. chuck."
,really love way dr chuck teaching.
,incredibly clear never get bored even lecture 20 minutes long.
,lecture feel like become expert topic.
,"however, course diluted.... 4-5 lectures 7 weeks little content, especially pay $79 required certification."
,"week contains lot videos that, although interesting, directly relevant course."
,finished whole thing 2 days ^^
,bonous videos good
,absolutely awesome course.
,dr. chuck earned first internship earning around 150$ per month age 18. i'm python trainer small organisation.
,enough exercise unfortunately + correction assignments!
,"think well video format always great, makes difficult find specific content course"
,"content good ,but teaching staff helpless"
,way expensive contents
,course really trivial.
,"maybe expecting much, material really simple."
,"also lot material lector things fun cool, really anoying."
,"please, try focus programming instead cool fun."
,thanks understanding.
,"took course follow-up part 1. loved part 1 excited optimistic part 2. absolutely background computer programming, phd college professor 8 years."
,"based prof. severance stated course 1, thought would ""click"" chapter 7; sadly case."
,beginning ch.
,7 realized neither lectures textbook (which btw pretty much 95% covered lecture slides) prepare student complete assignments.
,"prepare assignments: 1) watched videos 2/ times, 2) created slides taking screenshot slides, printed could take notes alongside slides rewatching lecture , 3) drew charts & figures vocabulary concepts, 4) read discussion forum assignments struggled around 1-2 hours."
,gave spending hours hours trying failing creating correct code.
,"eventually googled help internet, way able complete assignments."
,waste money course.
,"way connect instructor ask questions teaching assistant rude, unhelpful deletes comments like them."
,"i'm disappointed course, high expectations based first course."
,"originally planning take entire 5-course series, looking elsewhere learn python."
,unnecessary talking!!!
,talks lotttttttttttttttttttt!!!
,much unnecessary talking?
,can't get point straight away making video soooooooo long!!!
,hate it!
,love mr. charles.
,honestly appreciate effort put making graduation video.
,truly encouraging students learn really moving.
,"thanks much course, charles."
,i've enjoyed learned python series overall.
,resources overall videos book useful.
,coursera amazing offer courses affordable price.
,"unfortunately, last assignment course ""python data structures"", good experience using discussion board."
,"say, disappointed feedback one tas question posted."
,could help tone responses feel unnecessarily condescending.
,"oddly, hints comments instruct correct code wrong."
,spent unnecessary hours trying find solution based tas poor guidance.
,certainly know ta forum hundreds students time may overwhelming and/or mistakes happen.
,"accept that, tone responses, unnecessary, unmotivating, disrespectful."
,"playing around code, finally figured nothing guidance."
,odd experience ta.
,instructor great great.
,course gives idea use python real life.
,assignments challenging getting started python course good learner.
,teaching staff ruined experience deducted 2 stars out.
,"considering take course, keep mind rude replies teaching staff may happen here."
,book really gave details individual chapters.
,hence easy assignments quizzes without watching videos.
,"recommend specializations follow trend, students find difficult access internet use book guide."
,examples needed understand concepts especially tuples dictionary
,teaching staff helpful & rude.
,asked help & could get.
,"get help free colleagues, assignment turned meet taught."
,single line remove duplicates.
,"yet, could program whole thin alteryx faster & cleaner course."
,ok course overall.
,"however, recommend guys fire staff named tamara brunnock."
,"usually get along people pretty easily, staff downright arrogant, rude, unhelpful."
,"look profile see says things like ""this inefficinet approach "" "" this""."
,"and, one time replied question, like "" thank please dont't rude next reply"" deleted post?!?!"
,"believe python data structures, begineer course, inclusive welcome, tamara brunnock taking away values."
,like see dismissed postition!
,teaching assistance impolite.
,dropped whole course her.
,"second course python everybody specialization, corresponds second half previous course name."
,"first course (getting started python), found dr. chuck's thorough approach material likely approachable beginning programmer."
,"experience python, including previous course course genomic data science specialization, fair amount experience programming using r, found course easy.the course introduces common data structures python (lists, strings, files, dictionaries, tuples) functions used manipulate them."
,"dr. chuck excellent job introducing piece, although course bit light practice problems, probably better resources actually getting comfortable using regular basis."
,"book ""learn python hard way"" edx course mitx (6.00.1x) supposed two best resources there."
,"recently bought first enrolled second, i'm hopeful help become comfortable programming python r.overall, four stars."
,"gentle introduction data structures python, little light exercises needed become really proficient using them."
,really enjoyed lectures cannot believe learning programming pleasure!
,"importantly, dr. chuck intentionally included many mistakes teaching materials."
,happy finished course.
,learned lot him.
,"thought interesting learn language, wrong."
,today strongly recommend learning language help lot simple way solving things.
,thanks made course possible.
,able understand basics data structures easily work assignments.
,giving course 4 star review full five star one mentor (not instructor!)
,course - tamara brunnock.
,"discouraging teaching staff hard imagine, also speak teacher - get asked lot questions nature every day teacher / mentor, expect accept deal every single question/request nature job behaving otherwise wrong teacher."
,dr. chuck duplicate lectures youtube copies coursera videos - made another set videos uploaded online everyone use freely wish one videos 13 hours long!
,asked help twice get around writing code kept getting deviation desired output days end.
,"comments received ms. brunnock exactly helpful - vague unspecific case, seems asking learners questions codes way guiding them, sometimes works - again, know teacher good pose right questions learner make think answer see potential fault done feed correct answer right away."
,area programming designed 'everybody' early stages (this second course series five bet end fifth hardly qualify knowledgeable python person!)
,"technique work majority browsed previous months years communication learners ms brunnock got reassured initial take strategy, i.e."
,lots people posting get comment confused one guy even begged tell mistake suggested answer.
,saying mentors give straight answer - definitely not!
,learner work grown-ups self-study time.
,"never posted requests checking least ten fifteen posts reading confess, found helpful even people not."
,like sieving though sand mud get gold specks real valid help time violating coursera code conduct providing answers.
,"back two unhelpful comments - feedback unhelpful raised even questions side, asked never got reply."
,"waited days since progressing quite quickly time-wise, wanted get answers - codes alright besides fact worked?"
,"could made better, concise?"
,user-friendly logical / elegant dr. chuck never fails emphasize attributes truly good codes.
,"ask lot help coding itself, instead asked comment 'look', will."
,"guess, either never bothered look shout help marked 'passed' waste time?"
,"look, found tolerable unwilling spare couple seconds let know that."
,two problematic ones comments mentioned help lot eventually got autograder accept versions own.
,"self-studying - ready fact, since taught lot things life - novice, expected feedback presentability codes, simple/logical/easy debug case someone else got fix later real life - get idea."
,wanted know user-friendly point view someone knowledge area me.
,"wrote post asking disregarded way got lectured, quote, 'if mentor extra time, review code give feed back."
,please post thing multiple times.'
,"mind you, never posted thing multiple times - single posts assignment - believe considered 'please, check code' request different assignments repetitive, really qualified repetitive new task every time posted line - besides, else ask responsible person check work done?"
,"appointed one annoyed tons people asking questions years, one quit job get annoyed legit requests."
,basta.
,"shameful, ms brunnock."
,especially considering much excellent work effort explaining visualizing concepts python dr. chuck put.
,graduated still single meaningful comment.
,utterly disappointed put off.
,apply courses specialization hope encounter again.
,"ms mihaela mak leagues better, hope road."

,helped learn oops concepts well data structures.
,bonus material plus unmasking developers developed particular thing.
,course somewhat basic easy understand.
,thanks professor chuck making understandable wonderful experience students.
,fact like course basic much practically viable students good making fundamentals python.
,"suggestions improvement: - code snippets used slides summarized separate doc, viewed downloaded lessons, would helpful reference exercises."
,presenter show slides.
,picture-in-picture.
,"also learning r non-coursera mooc, find coursera course clunky distractingly esoteric."
,"coursera occasionally crashes attempting parse record python code i've written, code runs fine regular ide."
,"course particular also includes lots optional content either unnecessary (the best taco world video, example) unclear apply python (an interview inventor jquery, example)."
,"additionally, instructor often assigns variable names explain variable represents, makes videos bit harder follow necessary."
,"despite this, learned lot course."
,"despite fact course nice, hands-on activity worst ever."
,would never say practice activity beginners.
,rather frustrating.
,exercises complex beginners.
,ridiculous.
,mr. chuck tries fit many lesson topics one lesson.
,"without practicing easy codes make first steps, mr. chuck wants jump complex coding."
,entire especillization one basic course.
,how?
,removing instructore hobbies vidoes interview vidoes.
,( find youtube) insted uploading vidoes here.
,fake content.
,touch hash table stack.
,common data type python.
,
,absolutely amazing course!!

,"professor good funny, subject interesting, that's all."
,"basic course, easy follow challenging."
,"also (maybe easy), peer review compromised people really know they're there, comments clearly made without knowledge subject."
,felt practical examples needed.
,struggled getting exercises done.
,"even completed feel like knew - like ""ok working now, touch it"" feeling felt."
,"understand one might say, canned reply ""that programming is"" one felt different."
,i'm abandoning course reliance urllib.
,"library supported environment (anaconda) alternative, urllib3, different."
,i've attempted work around limitation 'requests' got far.
,imho course re-written using modern requests module.
,3 years back might good course lot needs updated.
,"less beating around bush, point stories point facts."
,assignments easy tweak line 2 given code done.
,final assignment like adding 1 print statement only.
,professor take enough examples quite difficult understand concepts.
,whole course difficult understand basics covered properly.
,"course says python everybody think so, prior knowledge html web developing."
,disappointed
,course needs improve insights online tutors discussion boards.
,"took month complete final assignment course, pay for."
,"would better insights discussion boards, would saved lot time money."
,"good morning still received certificate i've already completed tasks, 99% done, pulled first assignment uploaded wrong photo reviewed gave bad grade let correct it, solution?"
,"bit difficult since week4the lessons seem bit rush many details explained, caused confused lot code written way would code turns be."
,wish assignment could practical well.
,think hard learn course .
,"glad finish ,and study make sure good ."

,extremely useless.
,subtle assignments require little bit tweaking.
,"sudden change concepts difficulty compared previous course definitely live name, ""python everybody""."
,third course python specialisation basic 6 weeks.
,assignments repetitive pretty much spoon fed everything.
,looking challenging course you!
,knowledge distributed sparse courses.
,"lecturer often repeats goes topic, makes several videos waste time, since give information promised."
,felt lost course.
,"extremely interesting content probably well explained, hard keep content, much new info, less context piece new information."
,please provide information use python3 chromebook!
,"assignments hard do, since python app downloaded recognize commands, beautifulsoup!"
,wanted web page classification using python.
,solve problem programming skill?
,take one web page recommendation engine course find relevant pages
,professional course .
,"complete assignment copy sample code , change piece congratulations finished assignment"
,"course structure & lecture material pathetic compared assignments.i knew python still need struggle cases,for beginner course useless"
,high level difficult students familiar api .
,assignments completed understanding thorough
,"course ""everybody""."
,difficult beginners!
,"lecture videos teach algebra, hw assignments calculus-level questions!"
,"course (and specialization) started well, end way many things introduced student (me) really mastered python."
,course strayed far origins.
,"yes, course contains topics nice-to-know, means essential useful."
,meet expectations.
,course pretty shallow terms depth.
,assignments sufficient all.
,first weeks fine afterwards assignments difficult complete badly effect score
,many informations things went fast.
,first two weeks amazingly explained organized
,course offer complete knowledge includes many real world application examples
,explanations could clear.
,focus required urllib parsing.
,"compared previous two courses, one poorly structured, rushed unclear"
,still feel completed acquired knowledge course
,"find course useful looking for, boring!"
,good learning python use data science
,boring course abouve courses
,cannot complete course since labs working
,"good videos, way easy enough practice."
,"explanation xml, html, json enough"
,felt unnecessary speciatialization
,lots parts need explaination
,class challenging
,peer graded assignment good
,non 癡 all'altezza dei precedenti.
,undrestant completely
,good two
,much subject
,could wait finish course specialization write review.
,"even though first two courses specialization pretty straightforward, one terrorised me."
,"now, understand difficulty people might met previous two courses left mixed reviews."
,even know start bad course was.
,incomplete information online course could find textbook.
,"but, written scripts/programs textbook different/changed ones video."
,"moreover, assignments' descriptions hard understand use beautifulsoup follow links took 1 hour understand asked do."
,native english speaker could worded better.
,"issues as: - explanations installing beatifulsoup, where, unclear - accessing google api work anymore; supposed follow along example given work apis?"
,"- twitter changed way access api requires 3 tokens, 4 videos/textbook; guess look one internet too, properly grasp concept - missing information course/textbook approach assignments."
,"mind research own, supposed know look told need finish assignments?"
,"issue, reason signed coursera, infomation find online overwhelming seems one wants make programming easy someone clue start."
,would expect issue using coursera.
,"structure, ""written script"" explained actual script written bad confuse people badly."
,"part (using python access web data) easy compared previous courses terms topics contents touch beginner level, particularly assignments."
,"several portions course need improved, 1. lack full guidance coding workings (the assignments cannot done solely based lectures, external study research must - defeats purpose taking course, choose vendors better structured design contents?)"
,2. leading confusion learner assignment questions (no clear explanation expected outcome poor design assignment structure - e.g.
,"question, expectation, samples, steps steps guidance) 3. gap understanding (the details coding structures well explained beginner's perspective missing part lectures hands-on!"
,appears rush complete everything video lecture main topics instead explaining details theories hands-on come assignment taught lectures).
,much conduct research external sources/tips/guidance complete part.
,really good choice beginners pick new skillset world advanced technology?
,reminds course name - py4e (python everyone).
,"seriously, doubt it!"
,good progression python everyone series.
,difficulty complexity increases ten fold support limited.
,earlier courses series fully developed text supporting website- multiple chapters text/videos course.
,"course, course supported single section text."
,specialization feels like went reasonable challenge good support (textbook website) extreme challenge little support.
,tried course support (via email) got short semi-helpful response.
,tone response felt slgithly condecending.
,really wanted good course.
,"want learn python, place me."
,"try elsewhere, maybe within coursera, maybe elsewhere."
,running firefox v50 ubuntu linux v16.04.
,unable watch lecture videos due page reloading every 2 - 10 seconds.
,tried moving different video results.
,"know uc davis-specific whether coursera changed significantly since last time took class, course totally unusable."
,"would left review coursera rather course review, coursera make contact information easy locate."
,liked first 2 courses one horrible.i watch tons youtube videos ask help reddit subs order least get rudimentary grasp...all lectures rushed tasks confusing.i understand course cannot magically teach everything 100% least precise detailed.
,"moreover ,teaching staff rude hell.i love respect dr. chuck.i hope upcoming classes vague."
,"taking two great courses dr.chuck, course disestar."
,consumed energy motivation.
,sure wheter continue specialization dr.chuck.
,"process course always pretend like web programmer fact, could catch great portion course."
,sad... pitty
,"en este tercer curso, pas籀 de ser entendible retador algunas pruebas, para volverse frustrante, tener que estar buscando horas horas en otras p獺ginas, tutoriales foros acerca las evaluaciones, ya que para alguien que reci矇n lo lleva, se le hace imposible poder completarlas por uno mismo."
,details solve problem.
,instructor covered intro.
,"really disappointed 3rd course, first two good."
,aim course give skills students instead intro topic book.
,nowhere good first two courses specialization.
,high expectations spend time google youtube understanding things taught course compared time spend watching lecture videos!
,first assignment is: 1. trivial.
,2. someone graded 40% even though assignment exactly asked cannot re-submit it.
,whole course: brushes html way fast.
,compared first courses one lot worse.
,content treated trivial way (what's awful).
,"impression instructor simply considered already knew subject domain it, explanations poor entire course."
,"i'm rating course, looks i'm prevented go next course, ***that already started*** can't get back !"
,assume nothing say means thing.
,ticked off!
,encountered alot difficulties programs like beautifulsoup.
,didnt learn much compared past two courses specialization.
,please endeaor improe course
,"received 96% final result, even though obtained 100% every assignment."
,pathetic rating system.
,paid course would incensed.
,sorry course totally impossible understand without previous knowledge gap bewteen 2nd course one huge
,instead focusing python he's teaching xml http.
,introduced apis end.
,learn came for.
,course confused jumbled.
,dr chuck tries explain much 6 weeks result lot confused students.
,huge gap weeks.
,seems recordings made different time breaks logic videos.
,i'm getting coursera verification prompts often.
,happen courses i've taken/i'm taking
,poor order submit exam purchase course download book learn well.
,confusing course graded.
,spending time think ui rather course
,instructor good need help good luck.
,help people terrible stuck 3 days
,note: i'm rating course element python everyone specialization.
,"course well done technically severance great teacher, know thinking deciding students recently gained tenuous grasp python start work databases."
,"student began true beginner, s/he still fledgling pythonista time he's completely overwhelmed new stuff."
,"found json, xml, sql introduced, comprehension ""what's going on"" decreased around 95% 15%."
,eyes glazed looking code completed assignments tinkering around praying would work.
,assignment submitted reset recieving certificate
,like copying code paste place.
,also explain code written good beginner code must written live understand whole code .
,also assignment clear all.
,search know want exactly.
,hope improve next people take
,submitted week 5 assignment databases visualization(peer graded) yesterday.in submission got 70%.
,pass assignment get certificate need 80%.
,"since, want resubmit assignment option resubmit assignment.so please check issue help resubmit assignment get certificate."
,following note instructor.
,plz consider reset.
,used older version geodata longer applicable.
,need download updated geodata zip file using link given assignment page.
,using updated version allow add new location even using dr. chuck's api complete assignment.
,"new location park, museum, cafe, university, etc., something set submission apart others.you post request forum explaining read instructor note would like reset."
,please copy paste note requesting reset forum.
,finished course 4 days back still one assignment pending instructor grade delay im able get spelization certificate subscription ends tomorrow dont think im going subscribe
,charles severance one favourite professors.
,teaches stuff simplest way possible.
,delivers content friendly manner.
,"friendly meet chance, first sentence might ""hey chuck, wasup?"""
,"coming course content, understand included object oriented programming course."
,provides good exposure sql.
,"week geocoding, though walk everyline geocoding exercise, throwing gives exposure opportunity learn own."
,"instructor engaging, conceptual overviews excellent."
,here's would improve: (1) think would cost much take much time add honors content.
,would helpful anyone brushing material wants go little further.
,(2) last assignment absurdly easy.
,i've never programming assignment criteria simply run code someone else already written.
,that's lazy hurts brand name coursera university michigan.
,i'm sure students ('ahem) would happy produce honors concept rework final assignment.
,"necessarily bad course, final assignment wait graded."
,"know people, i'm going pay another month specialization i've already finished get piece paper states figure vague instructions."
,wish could give better score since like way instructor explains things.
,enough details many fluff videos.
,watch miss question final capstone quiz.
,great toy introduction database technologies - wish assignments involved running starter code making lines modifications.
,worst course ever!
,get reset week 5 submission lead completion specialization.
,teaching staff including @agnes barsi @mihaela mack know respond students respect forum.
,worst experience course coursera ever!
,never knew vital understand database development.
,also thought would outside realm knowledge want build databases analyse.
,makes easy comprehend.
,always thought python wanna-be programmers i'm proud say python language choice.
,sql scared hell took course.
,first stop i'm planning develop new model.
,instructor rate.
,pending long time.
,either delete complete it.
,learnt many useful sql statements know combine database operations python program.
,dr. chuck's lectures always comprehensible clear.
,course definitely (rudimentary) must take course anyone wants go data science.
,teaching staff's attitude behavior rude unprofessional.
,"asking simple things assignment graded, instructor different excuses took long time grade them."
,course great... definitely learn many things... kind hard went many times back forth lectures... however think learn many new things....
,"another course made greatly dr.charles , never expected reach far learning programming own."
,i've completed first four courses specialization i've decided capstone.
,"""most helpful"" reviews confirmed feared following 4th module end."
,"really wary, finished third module pretty quickly, concepts lectures simply become broad conceptual stuff less python learning code."
,"end third module, basically cutting pasting pre-written code making small tweaks it."
,"fourth module ""using databases"" starts great lecture classes object-oriented programming, imo focus whole module."
,lecture left feeling much learn oop got excited start coding again.
,"however, quickly segues sql databases, which, ok, sql interesting assignments started mostly cutting pasting pre-written code."
,"first lecture sql great, i'm module learn python, sql."
,learn write sql statements assignments pre-written python programs tweak sql bit... really feel like learning anything new.
,"would much rather done sql, whole week conn.cursor cur.execute stuff, learning actually write python code."
,lot handwaving stuff.
,last assignment literally running prewritten code taking screenshot result.
,even tweaking it!
,mean-- useful all???
,glad took first four courses specialization.
,"gave great overview python, showed little knack want pursue further."
,disappointed course wrapped up.
,"hearing capstone stuff worried about, i'm bowing it."
,anyway dr. chuck great lecturer.
,wish back half specialization little focused.
,"dr. chuck nice teacher bad experience course, especially assignment week 5. easy simple assignment basically follow dr. chuck's video."
,ideas need wait one week waiting teaching stuff mark it.
,otherwise unable receive certificate.
,gives feeling unnecessary long marking period increase time subscribing course earn money!
,"would give 0.0 star one guy ""mihaela mack"" ths stupid ever seen life"
,python course complete beginners
,thanks oportunity learn.
,"thanks coursera, university michigan course dr. chuck, good enthusiastic teacher!"
,best you!
,"instead previous courses, really appreciate one."
,"material broad, really hands coding python database e implementation."
,"get general overview database management, miss depth."
,"also dont really write much code, done you."
,"really makes excersises easy, deprives learning opportunities."
,
,assignment week 5 poorly instructed confused .
,spending time assignment course.
,assignment said add new address end file beginning file say something highlighting editing image.
,image editor new mac computer download class.
,"midst completing 5th course python everybody specialization, programming background prior taking 1st course learnt lot courses."
,put effort hours studying materials provided.
,"although, course unlike first 2 courses specialization learned write codes, gained knowledge due diligence researching experimenting codes help excelling assignments."
,"make use lecture videos, textbook code examples available us students, dedicate focus time achieve academic goals, get rid spoon-fed mentality, thank yourself!"
,"forums there, segregated week post questions peers dr.chuck? team teaching assistants help out; said that, please read pinned messages teaching staff week forum attempting assignments detailed grading process."
,really enjoyed taking courses including 4th one look forward completing capstone project following final course.
,thank dr. chuck team um coursera making courses available remotely!
,"course helped understand basics databases, case, sqllite, learned create table database using python programming, dr.chuck taught us use previously learned material practical example."
,"read file internet, parse json creating database finally visualize data."
,strongly recommend course amazing instructor.
,course well designed get fast launching programming & talking data python.
,"name suggests "" python everybody "", courses specialization really signifies that."
,python3 course extremely sloppy compared earlier python2 version.
,chuck acts really tired making course.
,examples: chuck writes white slide yellow.
,later yellow pen yellow database icon.
,"one pause, look closer."
,chuck copy pastes sql code.
,"provided us text, pause video 15 minutes start typing."
,"sql command uppercase, sqlite care apparently, discussed."
,dozens things like this.
,far simplistic assignments
,read comments reviewer...it appears acting like dictator.
,especially teaching assistant understand pain rest life living measly salary post-doc ph.d. even probably life well....they need calm little online line beginner course...you becoming billionaire course.
,would strongly recommend buy course...you wasting money.
,"assignment 5 got stuck, unable change answer again."
,"course week, unable get certificate"
,really disappointed week 5 peer graded assignment issue.
,"course good introduction concept of: -'objects', classes, methods python -sqlite -refresher basic sql statements, joins, clause, order by, limit -basics good data model relational database, multi-table relations, -one one, one many many-to-many relationships -working instructor's 'twitter' api -the end-to-end geocoding process using google maps, >getting set locations >constructing url string, >querying url, >retrieving results json, >loading geocoding results sqlite database, >retrieving geocoding dataset visualising web page using google maps almost every assignment, instructor put effort provide primer/base python script analyse validate understanding."
,"there, work understand actual assignment wants work coding assignment."
,"overall, course struck good balance easy (and coding exercises all) challenging (where courses provide primer material all, leaving learners struggle)."
,"learners background sql, come course confidence working objects, classes, methods end-to-end geocoding process."
,put effort work way content!helpful
,"dr. chuck, long time ago, probably 2 years ago so, enrolled first python course trying several times learn programming success."

,"third course specialization, lectures give enough allow students independently advance learning outside course."
,"honest, think instructor covers much ground short time students gain lot understanding."
,"furthermore, assignments quite straightforward requiring minimal adaptation supplied code."
,"module object orientated programming is, frankly, waste time distraction."
,practical exercises material run pace makes unlikely anyone without prior knowledge would make sense it.
,"more, reference to, use of, oop point course specialization."
,time would better spent expanding modules core topics using databases python.
,"positive side, external tools dr chuck's website seem work expected integrate smoothly coursera."
,"forums also remain supportive, although, courses, far less active old platform."
,still rate 4 star (albeit 4-) dr chuck engaging instructor still good progression specialization.
,would cautious taking standalone course.
,"previous three courses, dr. severance great job presenting material explaining code works."
,felt assignments book lacking little bit: 1. textbook needs updated include object oriented programming section covered week 1.
,"2. programming exercise oop section, quiz."
,"3. assignments textbook chapters 14 15. examples code works awesome, though, trade sorts."
,4. chapter 14 programming assignments require minimal programming python and/or sql.
,would liked little programming.
,"5. chapter 15 felt like shoved end, assignment really easy."
,"hoping little rigor one, also."
,"overall, good experience i'm looking forward finishing specialization capstone unlocked becomes available."
,4 5 series python everybody.
,"learn much pythin course, apply scanning web gathering data."
,scientific uses python programming scratch taught course.
,must write many students enjoyed course learned something new.
,took first 3 series (btw recommend take first 3 course taking particular one.
,several hw forces use prior knowledge.
,"rush through), able walk away courses feeling lot comfortable python."
,course much.
,"hey, course see python applied data science good introduction."
,stopping moving coursera course.
,caring capstone series.
,"unfortunately, i'll rate course 4 stars 5... begining course pretty boring, fatal grasp attention lot students, end way easy course suppose take concepts previously learned apply week."
,literally 100% last assignment need take screenshots that's it!!!
,"however, course incredibly good!"
,"explains excelence sql is, operate databases python!"
,teacher incredibly good assignments great practice learned.
,"therefore, would sugest anyone specialization take course, even though clearly see difference quality previous ones, always good course excelent teacher behind it!"
,course good overview sql interfacing sql using python.
,biggest issue assignments far straightforward.
,although prefaced dr. chuck course designed starting point learning sql - good job - think increasing difficulty assignments help reinforce topics covered.
,"although easily completed assignments, work pre-written code instructor required trivial tweaking."
,"cannot fault dr. chucks enthusiasm topic, however, great infectious...i certainly looking sql future."
,"think chuck easily one best instructors studied like previous courses, really good course well; however, think week 5 lectures, could spent bit time explain different concepts used/introduced programs, explained previously surely covered example use codecs.open use on..there examples well."
,"overall, course well taught although last assignment easy really test knowledge understanding subject."
,really like intro accessing web two common api's namely google location api twitter api.
,course falling little bit short introducing relational database model persistence technology only.
,instead providing introduction sql special language really would expect comparison different persistence approaches popular nosql vs standard relational model.
,"however accepting focus relational model course, would expect intro mapping sql alchemy."
,regarding persistence part course well balanced.
,extremely high level introduction sql use dbs data processing programs.
,"experience get feeling basic idioms apply, good start."
,"if, like me, already good sql knowledge little python knowledge quickly learn access dbs go videos easy overview interesting applications."
,"previous courses appreciated dr. chuck relaxed exposition interviews people names books, like tannembaum."
,"good course introduces 101 101 basics db design, well related libraries python."
,assignments rigorous require coding blank slate.
,"hence, i'd highly recommend students take time reverse engineer, well read comment supplied code."
,"furthermore, there's issue database design one assignments point code comments github: https://github.com/rahulthewaffle/python_databases_severance/blob/master/week3/ex15-2.py"
,helps learn deal database python .
,sqlite also taught see database.
,python programming help get data using api.
,extract clean data using python.
,really beginners course tried make simple.
,professor awesome could say that.
,need help outside topics like sql?
,brief topics given .
,nice instructor nice lectures too.
,little tougher course absolute beginner
,introduction databases integration python introduces real-world application programming introduction.
,"content informative, practical, rely heavily course's content future."
,"did, however, find course directed students toward relying existing code tweaking rather thinking process developing scratch."
,"reason, found course little weaker delivery previous ones specialization."
,"great coverage material, however sample scripts nearly complete required little, any, modification complete assignments."
,"novice programmers looking understand python interacts databases, best place start."
,nice general introduction sql.
,useful examples google twitter apis.
,bad getting harder use due limitations.
,"might worth considering using api resources, perhapse closer open source, like osm's nominatim openweathermap instead graded tasks perhaps assisted - code written shared."
,fact actual python code need shared encourage write clean well-commented manner
,"short, jam packed stuff need know order get working databases."
,ending lesson little disappointing tested suggested projects teacher talking instead download run program computer.
,"however, class equips knowledge get start data science database engineering, well good practice better understanding use python."
,dr. chuck breaks complex subject matter easily digestible chunks us newbies.
,issue course hardest parts assignments already done required us slight tweaking existing code.
,may may intended real challenge lies capstone project.
,"nonetheless, curious databases work, there's lots learn here."
,know did!
,course great high level - quick intro relational data modeling sql.
,would like spent time practice writing reading databases via python jump executing script sqlite/ database manager creating cursor executing formatted scripts fetching results little wide.
,"always, great materials, could done better practice."
,decent course assignments required lot initiative go search web order fully understand them.
,material understandable clearly presented allowing natural progression previous courses specialization.
,glad understand python works although sure confident enough apply higher order skills taught course.
,course great felt gained alot insight data mining done feel gained much skill using databases python.
,assignments making minuscule modifications existing code.
,think would better exercise either write new program assignment student build single program throughout course.
,"but, always, dr. chuck best."
,loved reviewing worked examples working assignments.
,understand course gave taste possible databases python.
,understand that.
,suggest involved extra-credit assignments.
,"part, shall take dr. chuck's samples line-by-line attempt reproduce (or reverse-engineering results) really grasp nifty syntax."
,concepts presented course helpful learning python used structure architect databases.
,would like exercises required generate code.
,large component downloading running code already written little editing generally debugging.
,felt course little easy towards end that.
,course gives basic information using python retrieve web data json html format.
,helpful makes learners feel good.
,course prepares almost ready codes every test homework.
,"could good reference people want know sth, much time digging complex way."
,"however, may also reduce strength learning."
,believe assignments tend easy promote using learned concepts different ways.
,"also, believe explanations missing."
,"general, think including material last assignment script code covered course (javascript/html) good idea end using something without understanding fully works."
,usual professor charles severance meticulous make course taker understand fundamentals database design querying.
,"however, certified database administrator lacked information normal forms - framework relational database architecture."
,"however, maybe requiring much short course beginners."
,however think would better codes spoon fed.
,"may could wrong needs taught - codes mostly written, simple hacks generate credits."
,hardwork mr severance invisible colleagues visible every lecture slides!!!
,thanks mr severance wonderful experience
,"course introduction sql databases, addition using python sql together accomplish desired outcome."
,"overall, course good, less time spent explaining everything detail comparison previous three courses; therefore, time must spent ensure learn everything understand every concept."
,course provided overview databases sql python used relation them.
,one gets introduction techniques data science.
,lot programming class.
,exercises/problems consisted making small modifications sample code.
,"dr. chuck knowledgeable, effective, entertaining instructor."
,works really well introduction databases use python.
,exercises maybe bit easy.
,"one hand, makes easy actually complete course (and still learn basics), hand, get familiar material."
,lecturer intelligent funny structured.
,think course bit shorter.
,final assignment could arranged way challenging is.
,"besides, lot features sql dig in, say left/right/outer join, group by, having, nested sql structure, basic sql formula/functions like max/min/sum/average tricky fundamental sql."
,lot code done based technologies people know about.
,dr. chuck get go detail that.
,think course structure cover everything (at least basic level) used code.
,students may find hard everyone cs background.
,"eloquent, patient clear explaining."
,"however, feel gone greater detail certain topics apis, geodata database management."
,"nevertheless, excellent course everyone interested database management (using python) try it."
,understand delving databases motive based brevity course rather appreciated.
,although superficial examples raised bar high.
,geo-coding example kind turned spirits since unable understand whether understand given js html codes.
,really enjoyed course however found language explained properly enough detail.
,also found worked examples complete.
,"go rewrite scratch understood fully - would nice couple assignments, one simpler one complex much leap"
,"great course, would great included perform data visualization python instead showing javascript code."
,would also like recommend write leat sql statements instead pasting them.
,"said that, thank chuck efforts!"
,think assignments could harder.
,"allotted tasks sound really difficult, given base code requires minimal changes, any."
,think challenging tasks would aid retention better.
,"is, think want look additional exercises textbook, something."
,way teaching sql good last week included visualization bad.i thought visualization would done using python jupyter done using javascript(which included course) giving idea using js html overall course good!
,good generic course.
,"thing i'd like see accessing types database - work environment utilizes ms sql server, need bunch researching trial error figure libraries need included connect databases."
,"usual, intuitive, clear, well structured amazingly informative."
,"missing star : bit less coding classes python - is, using lot code already written modifying it."
,"thus, might feel like know code ""seen"" it."
,course could've little challenging.
,"many assignments ""run files provided."""
,feel like ended getting know material quite much previous courses.
,ended re-writing lot code get know better.
,good instruction sql.
,final project simple given tools instructor armed us without throughout course.
,could've programming involved last assignment course really test knowledge integrating python sql databases.
,felt time could spent going python code last section.
,"code made available, students review code pace."
,may help go code video lectures themselves.
,"good course, exercises later weeks could bit challenging hence ding this."
,reading material also lined well online course - would great reading material shared chapter read course/week.
,dr. severance really put lot thought effort videos assignments.
,"course took big leap, terms program complexity, prior courses series."
,"course could twice long, dug deeper details."
,course touches python + relational databases.
,"specifically, investigates sqlite sqlite3 python library."
,work minuscule (assignments simply modify pre-written python scripts).
,"nevertheless, good introduction db coding python."
,"- update python3, i'm running python3 found difficult correct issues urllibs ifnal assignmet."
,assignments mainly related updating code existing file making something else.
,"however, would liked made code scratch assignments."
,"that, great introduction databases sql."
,"overall, excellent course, courses dr chuck."
,last assignment could demanding stretch learning capstone.
,real pity one pay previous courses order take final capstone :-( well done!
,like series lot.
,"like last assignment peer graded though, wait somebody see assignment grade it... :( otherwise, fun good introduction working databases!"
,"teacher good, hand assignments much simple."
,"challenge me, really get practice new things we've learned."
,"assignments copy/paste 3-4 lines existing code, make minor change it."
,"although theory getting denser, passed quickly, assessments light."
,"even though aim students investigate go deeper themselves, think prompted development."
,"+good integration python json etc -normalization there, least upto 3nf covered."
,would great somewhat challenging.
,wish coding final week.
,"give us expected schema program's output (which javascript html visualize from), us write python first parts output data fits schema."
,good intro databases perhaps bit easy lot code provided.
,would like create python code instead reusing provided course resources.
,"said, well laid delivered."
,course databases rather python.
,"good beginners, easy anyone programming background."
,"also would suggest providing mbox.txt file download, copy/pasting big amount overload laptop cpu."
,course perfect introduction using databases python.
,"gives intuition provides understanding important database management features, code sql, manage python interface."
,would say good course learn understand db interact python.
,"purpose course make us professionals, make us aware prepare us development."
,"great deal working course, especially peer-graded assignment last week."
,"worried assignment 2 days getting graded, finally relieved much."
,"course great, hope get final project."
,"little bit experience python, skipped first two courses specialisation project."
,"still want try 5th one, locked now~"
,course full database designing great experience.it bit tough keep beginning got familiar.you need prior knowledge database learn course need python.
,easy informative could challenging us modify code bit more.
,similar complaint coursera class ibm databases maybe limiting factor things structured graded.
,"think dr. charles' lectures really cool, practical excercises good: consisted, mostly, executing already done code printing stuff."
,think peer-grading unnescessary too.
,course nice introduction relational databases.
,"however, lessons address database design sql topics, thus people may consider fair include course python specialization."
,would perfect issue gooogle api key week 5 assignment frustrating figure without clear guidance.
,walkthrough discussion forum could used pictures help debug issue.
,reason can't give course 5 star rating final assignment substantial enough.
,otherwise best course series beginner someone trying refresh programming knowledge.
,loved teaching assignments little rigor involved.

,course taught databases (the general idea) create visualize data python.
,"forme, one useful courses spezialised program univ."
,michigan.
,"thought informative, felt assignments lacked challenge."
,never spent 15 minutes 80+ % code already provided basically fill blanks.
,solid foundational database concepts python looking learn basics brush fundamentals.
,"however, looking advanced topics, might want look advanced classes."
,"get learn basics sql course.a good chunk code used assignments explained lectures, solve similar problem assignment shown lecture."
,"done courses specialization, found lectures week 4 week 5 involved less modification existing code, thereby reducing ability try coding one's own."
,another great class covers lot information builds nicely preceding classes.
,would like see additional exercises per topic complex.
,maybe add extra credit bonus one.
,highly recommendable instructive.
,yet content course bit introductive learned much sql database skills using python.
,"though, suitable beginners."
,"towards end course, code starts getting lot complex."
,"even though dr. severance said worry lot them, feel understand material fully previous courses."

,gracias por tan apreciada oportunidad!
,i'd expected difficult.
,"last assignment super lame, odd."
,little easy.
,especially last grade
,excellent resources instructions
,better use python 3 version.
,"course easy, informative."
,"objective, little simple."
,like course great.
,covered depth..just overview
,expected practical
,good way start databases
,well explained layman.
,good introduction databases.
,felt happy learning sqlite
,quit useful good beginner
,materials added!
,quick peace explanations.
,great entry level course.
,fun playing database
,"nice course, really enjoy it."
,homeworks way easy.
,sql could detail.
,awesome course till date !
,useful sir thank sir
,assignments harder...
,learned lot class.
,challenging entertaining
,assignments easy :(
,really enjoyed course..
,nice coaching chuck
,could gone depth
,using database python
,good teaching dr chuck.
,still needs practise
,good hands sessions
,nice piece course
,
,peer grade slow
,little bit easy
,add assignments
,lovely course here.
,nice done always
,much exercises.
,solid instructor

,first 3 parts specialisation great way get python.
,everything useful explained pretty simply.
,two criticisms would challenge nearly much courses cs50.
,projects relatively simple comparison.
,second little time watching instructor write actual code feel would pretty useful.
,using databases python installment looking forward to.
,really deliver though.
,rarely wrote code unless following along worked examples.
,"projects involved editing 2 3 lines pre-made code which, i'm going honest, felt like cheating ourselves."
,week 5 almost non-existent.
,felt incomplete final project felt like one week 1 projects ensure python everything running system correctly.
,one translate well online course.
,class reached bit understood.
,applications distributed assumption would able edit complete requirements assignment.
,bit confusing understand do....edit write something different.
,"understand topics, assignments hard grasp needed."
,teacher good job explaining content shows patience videos.
,think requirements difficult pull online environment using free tools.
,"would liked use sql server connect legit api using standard connection methods, sure realistic type course."
,"overall, would take again."
,enjoyed learning databases introduction sql.
,lessons great instructor well spoken always.
,"said, found course less consistent difficulty previous courses specialization."
,"one assignment completely off, difficulty complete required actions, description would assessed unnecessarily ambiguous."
,"assignments easy almost code already written, sometimes 0 changes needed make run properly."
,"personally, would appreciated exercises better understand nuances code go get practice i'll still play around time."
,"loved it, lots good information everything hand that's needed learn python databases."
,really well taught - except final assignment.
,zip file outdated cost entire day.
,would recommend depending forums fix problems assignment rather update assignment.
,buggy think make point intended make.
,learned things cost time wanted pay - deadlines real life can't afford get hung like learn something taught explicitly course.
,"thanks, yes, much thanks course, please fix assignment."
,felt like course specialization organized.
,"first object oriented class practical assignment, others did, contributing learning."
,passed assignments think i've mastered material much previous courses specialization.
,"seems material could broken two courses, squeezed one, instructors provide 99% assignment finishing rest 1% helping learning."
,would much better required work assignments (possibly step step splitting course).
,"engaging teacher, learn much course early ones specialization."
,concepts taught relatively straightforward (e.g.
,relational databases) assignments required use unnecessarily complex code datasets.
,"final assignment involved complex code require understand (rather, update data, run existing code take screenshots) - felt rushed, insufficient effort spent trying create useful learning experience student."
,"decided go ""capstone"" project completing course."
,"felt weeks 1-4 went reasonable pace, week 5 material rushed."
,"programs written instructor presented quickly examples, content programs already known presently explained, like ""buffer"" built-in function (found chapter 3 dr. chuck's book covered course) ""pass"" keyword, find python reference manual explanation."
,week 5 programs quite advanced would liked time spent explaining perhaps related programming assignment two help us learn material.
,"3/5, great professor lectures good textbook, class structured way rush us every new concept without lingering practice revisit material, assignments seemed use lot code supposed learn understand -- use sake completing assignments, thought great contribution learning."
,little much easy side.
,know learning every detail code necessary - understanding broad applications important gives vision goal understanding may get there.
,details researched.
,ways necessary reinvent wheels.
,still feel like tweaking preloaded code rigorous enough actually learn doing.
,class much easier previous 3 courses cert.
,"dr. chuck still great instructor, think course lost pedagogical value compared courses 1, 2 3 specialization."
,"mean teach students design algorithms, instead, offers already-made algorithm serves debugging exercise anything else."
,wish see challenging course future.
,course started excellent introduction object oriented programming.
,"however, explanations databases sql hurried, python programs complicated adequately explained."
,i'm also sure whether point providing easy peer-reviewed assignment teaching assistants also grade it.
,course difficult learned python scratch like me.
,codes fully understand throughout course.
,"tried finish assignments, felt like revising codes web without understanding them."
,"however, previous courses, dr. chuck good explaining material."
,"previous courses, student challenged apply learned concepts research reading py4e textbook."
,"course, textbook content covered material advanced useful online exercises."
,feel like course quick cursory even fundamental understanding sql syntax projects.
,feel portion course move little quickly terms introducing new sql concepts.
,"first couple python program demos head completely spinning, think could largely avoided couple slides piecing together logic programs."
,"that, another great course!"
,course whole specialisation went quick me.
,thought assignments way harder content lectures.
,"took quite long te figure things out, use help friends."
,always felt like missed part lectures additional explanation
,"good experience last assignment instructor said copied student ,and explained happened.. know honor code (trust) always right sometime things happen whether unintentionally."
,"one request, review last assignment reset it."
,lecturer honestly bit slow coverage content scribbling untidy.
,also seems want intentionally make sql look like simple avoids giving interesting facts thinks may complicate content would good know anyway.
,course could better.
,wasted much time finding needed assignments.
,think course need updated bit last assignments guesswork find files needed.
,spent much time trying work old python2 file.
,"quick path, reading addition watching lecture videos."
,hope step step lecture students directly deeply learn sophisticated coding instead inputting data using given completed 90% completed program.
,explanations could better course surrounding databases.
,quiz questions misleading via word usage.
,"well as, example code given cases work search stackoverflow answers."
,"good course overall, instructions last assignment incomplete (the full requirements found forums), students given lower grades following instructions exactly, frustrating."
,general like course.
,material way present it.
,tons problems passing assignments getting certificate.
,finish took 2 days 3 days get certificate.
,slow takes lots energy.
,"informative course, wish assessments exercises difficult."
,"time, editing lines code submitting result."
,assessments challenging would appreciated!
,"unfortunately, i'm kinda disappointed course."
,especially final assignment.
,could ask much interesting taks information provided.
,hope much better experience 5th part specialization
,"content sql straightforward clear, useful."
,information relating api especially week 5 clear enough like copy paste work.
,tas course ae helpful explaining examples patience!
,teacher wonderful always.
,"course given sqllite, would liked bit experience raw sql queries."
,course shows create manage databases python efficient way.
,well taught exercises simple course.
,previous courses exercises challenging started scratch.
,editing piece code can't compared writing one yourself.
,course lectures still awesome programming assignments become difficult almost solvable without additional material.
,"however, probably still best videos topic."
,missed details exercises last part course.
,"example, geoload/geodump/where-data could given exercises course joined end make map solution."
,think code write enrolled students.
,learn something copying lines code making minor changes?
,running already wrote code like last section?
,ok. homeworks quizzes easy feel could challenging.
,programming assignments basically change 2 3 loc done it.
,surface level look creating sql database python.
,skims topics quickly go depth write code effectively build database scratch.
,course overall helpful i've learnt lot ways sql.
,"however, problems fairly rudimentary pose challenge written prior."
,"great teacher, nice range topics, well explained."
,unfortunately assignments trivial boring.
,anyway worth taking along courses specialization.
,covering sql databases python.
,"lot code prepared, make really simple changes it."
,good terms learning code.
,assignments way tough compared learnt lectures.
,simply used many functions libraries without good explanation them.
,course showed lot pre-written code exposed databases.
,"learned lot, felt like less previous specialization courses."
,loved teaching.
,video great examples too... almost program!
,course 'too easy' feel practice enough!
,awesome stuff.
,"useful things covered, student able tested creating code, run (simple( edit existing code."
,last two weeks things clearly explained.based given less rating course compare two three courses.
,course goes little fast gave little knowledge sql basics.
,libraries discussed previous lectures came assignments.
,wonderful course problem certification.
,get chance resubmit peer graded assignment help out.
,"homework modify existing code, lessons skimming indexes."
,learned less courses series.
,"everything fine except final assignment, related material course, running someone else's code main skill"
,"assignments challenging enough, especially final one."
,however lectures interesting engagingly delivered always.
,"course taught well clearly, however programming assignments easy, feel done much simplification."
,"exercises course poor, simple require coding, changing one two lines."
,topic interisting
,ok. lectures good.
,"book needs updating, exercises would helpful practice learned class."
,class interesting many topics covered.
,"would preferred self coding, rather small edits"
,good course teaching vast topics quickly summarized way.
,needed explanation deeping several topics
,hands-on projects tasks needed order strengthen fundamentals dealing databases using python
,many new things python.
,mostly introduction python capabilities databases/ overall pretty good class.
,"focused much sql rather python, really helpful people already know sql (like myself)"
,thing learned course use sql python...the rest lectures fillers
,database code walkthrough.
,details... hard understand code :(
,nice course include enough python code database vendors challenging enough
,issues course week 5 task many issues many people problem.
,"short lectures easy assignments, good overview starting point studies."
,find course useful learn seems gives guideline python database.
,week 5 well explained structured.
,things confusing concepts missing.
,seemed little bit superficial... almost copying pasting code...
,exercises need work done students expected actually learn stuff.
,interesting lot code unexplained assumes understand it.
,think would good include course following topics: 1) nosql databases 2) orms
,intro class time required make small adjustments sample code
,little amount exercises/assignments required part course....
,"things way deep programmers, enjoyed much previous"
,"good, rather brief."
,"teach basics, uses python 2, 3."
,course material good assignments boring unchallenging
,assignment level mark.
,way easy obvious problems there.
,think explore libraries constructs algorithms.
,much hands-on work course.
,give us homework please!
,could expand libraries used writing codes course.
,"rather interesting, felt questions programs easy."
,course details.
,feels like lot skipped.
,"plz last lecture course, better understanding me."
,"interesting content, well structure lessons easy assesments."
,videos brief cover difficult content.
,base previous courses expecting one.
,please grade week 5 assignment .i needed certificate
,simple need use sample code.
,would've liked assignments independent.
,challenge terms quiz assignment
,"course interesting, tasks way easy."
,"good course beginners, theoretical"
,assignment could lot challenging.
,i'd rather program user
,would better harder assignment.
,assignments easy level.
,quite looking for.
,in-depth modules.
,nice course enough exercices
,clear first 3 courses
,assignments way simplistic
,work seemed little light.
,low practice exercises.
,could use hands coding
,expecting this.
,little simplistic
,disclaimer: finish course.
,decided week 2 use different course learn databases python.
,"value availability kind courses free, like style teaching mr severance."
,"hard time watching 15+ minute videos full day work already front computer, teacher go straight point make clear sentences (if deaf person reading transcript, would struggling follow)."
,"interested history people databases etc., criticise that, people might interested."
,however think stretching simple concept 10 minutes helping students grasp going on.
,"hand, liked cheap access book faster read subject sit 15 minutes front video, skipping ahead, trying guess important bits are."
,"plus, running us code teacher write explains good way engage."
,"student think understand, hard pressed write code asked."
,"that's decide go interactive approach learning, lots examples."
,assignments cover good set tools; classes databases.
,would introduced classes much earlier emphasize critical coding habits productive programmers: modularity reusability.
,"unfortunately, classes seem included afterthought."
,introduced week 1 never seen again.
,inheritance mentioned explored important documentation feature ignored.
,lectures extoll wonder sql even mention outer joins.
,"later examples, databses used house data; data extracted python variables simple queries, manipulated python."
,programming exercises consist running poorly written code posting results peer review; students instructed grade leniently.
,example code looks like hobbled together worked never edited clarity.
,"although want write negativ comment, choice saying course almost useless understood anything basics sql university."
,"sql language explained all, full commands supposed copy paste program."
,one wants explain sql one start basics language beginning talk single command / word sql language build.
,learning copying pasting full commands definitely help.
,"addition, expected learn basics data visualization certain libraries end (as always) nothing copy prepared program change little easy things works."
,good thing course sometimes dr. chuck broached certain topics quite interesting hear made notice learn topics (obviously somewhere else).
,"definitely love instructor, class really poorly structured."
,"could understand course material, use instinct basic logical thinking pass assignments."
,"course teach write code, give vague idea python do."
,"enrolled vba specialization taking course, one really good."
,"fair assignments, great explanation, important all, able write hundred lines code (maybe exaggerated little bit) independently passing course way taught force learn understand."
,"class, confused beginning still confused finishing course."
,"feel like course 3 specialization, everything taught effortless way get certificate."
,course specialization seem belong rest material.
,"seems place, little done relate learning python."
,"moreover, learning databases sql easy; rather taking whole course, content could relegated one week lectures conjunction external references reading."
,four weeks spent external topic interesting discussion using python databases glossed haphazardly last week.
,"big fan specialization think prof. severance great job explaining basics python short amount time, course needs restructured."
,course basic helpful.
,many programs read like reading textbook college.
,expect class better that.
,many concepts programs also skipped gives impression dr. chuck thoroughly aware concepts.
,disappointed teaching topics covered class
,"course focused sql python, would given 5-star rating."
,"however, course tried tackle concepts once, neither justice."
,"best, course gave peek db connections python."
,left wanting more.
,another disappointing course python specialization offered umaa.
,assignments laughable.
,mostly superficial course.
,reason undertook course already paid 5-course specialization.
,"far weakest python courses, missing videos little information actually using db python... quite disappointing, rely documentation another course complement skills."
,okay there's lot tweaking code actually building own.
,first two classes specialization great progress like writing less less code.
,"come background teaching 18 years, sql."
,biggest criticism course lack preparation culminating activities.
,course saves challenging work last 2% course.
,"even would okay, prepared via practice early rigor end."
,"assistants fellow students try best help forums without cheating, way."
,"many students needing much help final part course, speaks ineffective inadequate instruction early course."
,teaching knowing material engaging.
,"real work instructor create instruction builds students' knowledge prepares tasks logical, methodical progression."
,"course like playing monkey bars light tumbling 90% time, suddenly asked stick landing olympics uneven bars."
,exaggerate make point frustration.
,instructor seems written read script prior recording - stumbling words distracting reduces learner comprehension.
,way practice coding feedback module.
,"practice exercises end module include feedback, hints, examples - may well test."
,stopped two weeks - wasting time.
,videos contain material necessary get basic understanding relational databases sql.
,ended skipping lot parts videos extremely slow pace.
,lectures also feel scripted well awkward enjoyable watch.
,"tests mostly ok, sometimes tasks possible solved knowledge learned limited sql-version available (sqlite)."
,sometimes felt like creators solve submitting.
,final assignement quite mess.
,"lot repetitive work, sometimes questions plainly dont make lot sense."
,eg: correlation factor b?
,show looking top 10 results a... statistically meaningful!
,"virtually assistance staff regarding numerous clarifications necessary even understand last assignment (peer-review), i'm pretty sure go correlation and/or regression course, let alone hypothesis testing."
,i'm pretty sure able finish course considering plethora uncorrected problems plaguing course.
,recommend class evaluated quality assurance.
,student experiencing problems assignment.
,forums week 4 teeming unanswered questions regarding assignment unclarity.
,recommend contacting ucd telling really need solve problems class.
,"best, -cs"
,many quiz problems poorly constructed!
,"told fact ""ohh... forgot tell value string, need fix field attempting min/max asking for."""
,design better course!!!!
,going edx sql class instead uses datacamp back end!
,great course good learning experience course expecting course got knowledge happy take course.
,improve technical skills course mostly helpfull sql database.
,could please give least ***one example*** function introduced lecture videos???
,"week 3 & 4, complex functions/features introduced ***just codes, sample output***!?"
,expect know output would be?
,"may say could run code myself, learn better way."
,"true, situation ""1-minute job you, 10-minute job me""."
,leveling bar benefit course - case beginner level course!
,course incredibly poorly designed provide sufficient guidance learn sql.
,"lectures poorly delivered, output shown command got discussed."
,clear whether ms st. lawrence ever tried stuff talking about.
,"""final project"" (a) quite tedious; (b) parts quite bit complicated anything actually done before; (c) grading ""peer review"" seems mean may wait week two, ten?"
,assignment gets graded... thus get dollars sucked wallet monthly subscription.
,"bailed 7-day free trial over, felt even hours put point waste."
,"want significantly better intro sql, look ""postgresql everybody"" specialization chuck severance umichigan."
,"content course good, quizzes fine, final project total mess up, inconsistent contain course potential, able apply knowledge"
,"lessons well structured, would much easy explain sql interactively explainging concept sql, creating query highlighting particularly important query seeing result querry."
,instead done old fashioned power point.
,"first set concepts, additional information application, e-learning allows much interwoven structure, might initial work creator course clearly would add lot value students."
,sometimes course misses explaing relevant detail.
,"example last weeks lecture date, learned could operations like date('now') - datecolum, would return time difference years, days, hours."
,would intersting know is.
,last assignment
,lectures seem incomplete.
,"several sections, google information understand lecture topic."
,"course listed beginner level course prerequisite, throughout lessons felt like missing key basic information."
,"course recommendation 20 hours, 3-5 hours week."
,"first week fell parameter, hours required increased week, last week twelve hours including final project."
,"ideally, course considers adding complete explanations examples lectures (including outputs), practice coding, depth exploring data making inferences queries."
,"hola, es tan bueno que puedas correr c籀digo mientras aprendes con ejemplos."
,"course, wrote review, gave three stars."
,"now, sense need change add it."
,"yes, actually changed final rating three stars one star."
,"(below quick review, want waste much time it.)"
,"beginning, claimed certain participation so-called ""discussion"" optional, participate order even allowed move course."
,"claim false, one cared take care it."
,"claim indeed true, indeed participate, indeed optional, course case would allowed move on."
,"either way, immediately created ""bad taste"" speak."
,"seemed errors sloppiness quiz questions sets multiple choice answers, annoying."
,"quiz questions clearly put, sometimes -- would even say often -- difficult understand question."
,"sometimes also seemed though quiz code questions suddenly went far compared material taught, part due course's lack practice."
,"instruction videos also poor, well optimized."
,"example, instructor's audio lot ""wet sounds"" it, speak."
,"also, instructor's teaching unpleasant listen to, sounded awkward, though overly scripted unnatural."
,also errors word name match code on-screen.
,"maybe good instructor outside coursera, could tell videos."
,"sometimes, audio even cut off, seemed."
,"earlier mentioned lack practice course, must lot practice yourself."
,"already knew things there, usually find way around computers, on, anyway, sometimes easier time."
,also understood statistical concepts asked later on.
,"even so, decided quit final assignment, (1) beginning final assignment (or rather right it) unclear proceed coursera it, wasted time finding out; (2) course's sloppiness, looked though, using sqlite course, suddenly use mysql coursera's online sandbox (which may big deal, still strange choice course), really enter link use online sqlite interface yelp dataset, found roaming so-called ""discussion"" fora time, wasting time so; (3) assignment questions even asked, (statistical) topics even covered course, and, again, hardly practice course prepare you, making even poorer course."
,"read reviews, especially ones criticizing course."
,"overall, relatively many giving low ratings, right: really poor course."
,understand course high score.
,"short, poor course, one cares update properly, would recommend course taker get it, preferably free, leave quickly possible."
,first course ever took coursera honestly wondered like coursera able stay business.
,stopped halfway variety reasons.
,instructor incredibly awkward camera read teleprompter entire time.
,ended courses (by instructors) realized many basic pieces information left out.
,"little hands-on practice throughout course quizzes even show correct coding got wrong, able learn wrong."
,"glad found courses take subject, i'll avoiding teacher/school on."
,can't pay course get certificate.
,free 7 days subscriptions never ends.
,can't send tests get results get certificate.. lost lot time... bad
,questions scored incorrectly though correct.
,command line work.
,"course quiet good & descriptive, yet cover lot sql use platforms connect database, also, differences platforms."
,really helped learn sql level confident enough add resume.
,peer assignments bit challenging hence interesting well.
,want money back
,=) clear walkthrough important concepts sql use certain functions certain tasks.
,=( wish practice questions interative.
,"=( also would great ""real-life"" sql practices involve solving actual question might encounter data scientist working tech company."
,"thanks much sharing us, sadie!"
,"teacher really good knowledge sql really respect that, someone familiar sql finds difficult give quiz without side side practice topic"
,"beginner course, high level little time explanations spent topic."
,quizes expect syntax gone order correctly answer questions.
,received better explantions needed w3school brief high level explanaton ocurse.
,"instructor tends stumble words alot causes confusion examples within presentation really clear arent based real world, table 1 table 2 etc."
,"debated review wonder also witin leanring style, reallized course type fit variety learning styles google courses do."
,"material good, staff i'm giving 1 star."
,"finished course submitted final assignment peer review, ""in progress"" 4 weeks, acceptable delay learning progress."
,staff way monitor assignments time resolve.
,"respect time, please respect ours."
,enough examples lectures.
,impossible remember sql commands course provide practice questions quiz.
,"also, instructor keeps moving around explaining makes hard focus, course interactive all."
,aware many students sandbox necessary completing quizzes end leasson work.
,known issue far lecturer commented
,"course shows syntax, teach write."
,i'm still confuse syntax taking course.
,i'm fairly proficient r wanted add database language data science repertoire.
,data science jobs ask sql thought perfect starting point learning.
,"found learning language fairly straightforward, especially many sql-type commands built r packages (like dplyr)."
,"job comprehensive relational database but, usually use point click interface make queries- i'm proficient i'll start using sql though."
,"additionally, hoping pick sql starting grad program analytics ""hit ground running"" ready classes focused database management data engineering."
,able accomplish without question.
,"really liked course, surprising given coursera's data science content excellent."
,final assignment thorough helped put together lots focused questions might encounter using sql data scientist.
,really helped solidify learning.
,"$60, brainer getting started language."
,i'm satisfied course!
,"good structure, lot practical tasks examples."
,"parallel, solve hackerrank tasks course gave everything pass easy."
,"really appreciate final peer-review assingment, looks close real-life analytics little bit challenging me."
,much pleasure done it) strange pronunciation sql)) thank lot course sharing knowledge.
,"clearly-explained, organised lecture flow materials, easy follow, burdened great details beginners emphases made crucial aspects database management sql."
,course fuels motivations learning outside class.
,"confusion foundation sql, great course really builds confidence claim new skill take project!"
,accessed course evaluate potential course colleagues working knowledge sql (running stored procedures writing queries).
,course good anyone even know sql is.
,"like instructor too, pace adequate ability transfer knowledge high."
,"definitely recommend course anyone works ""data"""
,"overall good course, wish different format."
,"instead instructor left presentation right screen, wish instructor present screen using pen explain concepts."
,"also, could code examples students screen, instead showing us already written code examples."
,far course great introductory classes.
,took ibm's sql data science bad experience.
,course well structured clear concepts well-taught speed.
,far 5 stars.
,i'll update review i'm fully done
,enjoyed course learned basic understanding sql.
,final project difficult seems geared towards advanced sql users.
,first exposure sql find final project frustrating need refer texts

,"without writing lot queries, simply possible really learn sql."
,videos short need much effort finish.
,easy understand well explained.
,girl talks fluency slowly easy understand also pretty it織s nice see.

,"sas, r)."
,wonderful course really interesting content.
,home work liitle bit hard think work hard enough solve it.
,special thanks coursera team course !!
,"exciting use sql help analyze data, powerful easy-going language use future modelling & analysis work."
,"course really helpful, thankyou."
,best course sql best teacher.
,use visual part explaining statement.
,like output shown example.otherwhise best course ibm sql
,"helped learn basics little things great importance, kept mind writing sql queries data analysis."
,"though course foundation sql, completely taken away teacher teaches sql."
,strongly recommend anyone wants learn sql.

,i'm still week 3 course i'm yet finish course.
,course content week 1 week 2 amazing!
,"explanation, enthusiasm instructor teaching, examples description well clear cut definition term made easy learn concepts."
,thank putting great course material.
,"said, week 3, concepts get tougher explanation detailed number examples."
,"however, that's seen videos."
,hardly examples.
,tables output get submitting query shown.
,"without looking table contents kind output type join query gives, difficult understand concept."
,:/ hope coursera something this.
,think right pace right amount information.
,"normally, get bore instructor explain many things got it, she/he continues explaining."
,loved instructor goes right point waste time repeating thing again.
,piece happy final assignment.
,things explained course easy solve.
,"course, figuring answer, seems easy, person get it."
,"overall, loved it."
,"would given 4.5, instead 4, able."
,great exercises quizzes really test sql knowledge.
,feel confident ability work basic sql commands modify data set analysis.
,"found videos helpful introduce topics, felt like gained understanding exercises."
,instructor knowledgeable explained concepts awkwardly.
,appreciated comparisons metaphors included.
,"overall, really good course someone brand new sql like myself."
,look forward applying skills practice integrating data analysis tools.
,"course informative, hands-on type questions mid-video."
,internalizing information would much efficient seeing results queries answering poorly worded questions.
,"final assignment one great effort minimal effort depending individuals interest trying complex queries comfort zone, sides coin end certificate hand."
,"so, like courses life, get put it."
,better someone give learners advice project.
,really hard finish complete project learners themselves.
,"what's more, starters, everyone knows little, basic knowledges, know project."
,"better someone professional course, like ta someone give us advice project could better sample answers finally finished complete course."
,"hi, started course, far great, data models, part 1:thinking data, think typo last question module."
,"one answer choices ""a translation system used communicate data scientists"" probably meant write ""a translation system used communication data scientists"" (leaving ""for"") figured might want know change people sign course."
,"good, clearly-taught course."
,feel like i've learned lot certainly confident sql starting out.
,i'd interested advanced course people.
,"beef course questions graded quizzes clearly written, gave lot grief (thus, 4 stars)."
,please consider vetting questions.
,"good overall course, like order topics introduced they're application real world events."
,"request course topics go little depth (explanation complex examples) could optional video watch instructor coding quizzes, explains reasoning behind queries create."
,course covers many great issues.
,problem course way tackle sql first 4 videos.
,think totally gut confused.
,"after, read articles provided reading material fully understand concept."
,suggestion change sequence videos put videos student done reading part.
,modules carefully planned precise.
,"reading materials really helpful get better understanding subjects, quizzes end week thorough cover every important point."
,"one thing think improved way teacher presenting lessons, unfortunately little bit monotonous."
,"i'm totally new sql even beginner found lessons way slow, assignments interesting questions peer review difficult understand."
,"teacher clear, structure logical able give good simple tips."
,i'll recommend course whoever wants get sql
,"however, questions final ambiguous challenging, final whole take much longer anticipated 2 hours."
,"hand, make final, come great introductory understanding sql end course."
,"final assignment ambiguous (many questions misworded leading wrong sql codes, almost impossible decipher asked exactly) course would got 5 stars me."
,otherwise liked pace material maybe week 1 enjoyed coding quizzes.
,"introduction sql , found useful well structered order get better grasp topic."
,thing improve part concerning self joins examples shown videos get all.
,maybe add examples.
,"sum up, good course."
,great place start absolutely sql experience.
,videos well paced thorough.
,final project could use cleanup--as indicated forums full people asking questions.
,i'd take another series started around level windowing functions.
,course gives good info beginners.
,wish exercises lessons.
,felt overwhelmed informations memorise test end week.
,think tests lessons would help better memorise things.
,course really great learn basics quickly however huge drawback grading peer asignments.
,coursera courses without this.
,"invest time peer grading, get certficate though scored excellent course quizes"
,"overall good course starters sql dtaa science filed, however felt could hands-on oriented examples, mainly lecture contents, rather things could shown visually better understanding."
,thank videos.
,really appreciate way sql taught course.
,"limitation coding given student match coding answer , displayed incorrect."
,however coding might technically right generate output.
,amount content covered course comprehensive.
,videos precise useful.
,practice tests weekly assignments helpful.
,peer review assignment poorly worded ambiguous.
,good job guys !
,nicely instructed sadie st. lawrence.
,way things explained examples helped understand topics better.
,felt little explanation normalization understanding er diagrams would could better
,quizes coding tasks worded pretty badly confusing many students.
,needs reviewed edited.
,"also, practice tasks videos would lot helpful rather giving 10 videos row."
,"course structure well laid reaching final week, hungry learn concepts practical uses sql."
,also feel examples coding assignments practice.
,great sql course!
,would love see case examples videos week?
,"videos, felt bit confusing understand spesific cases use joins, unions statements."
,"first weeks informative easy follow, however week 3 week 4 seemed disjointed."
,"topics covered briefly, feel like understanding quite complete."
,videos bit lengthy course could shorter 10-20% time perspective content staying same.
,overall good course anyone need learn refresh skills.
,nice expect us know sql programming well.
,nearly enough exercises understand queries well.
,feeling lost practice tests especially.
,really good information sql beginner actually informations %80 sql wanna start structured query languages good place.
,good work :)
,"great beginner class also teaches critical logic thinking, business want analysis type jobs data science general, something useful actionable."
,great course work!
,loved pace course examples.
,instructors speech pleasing easy understand.
,would loved difficult sql queries practice.
,thank everyone charge course.
,training platform good support orders sql must training lesson.
,nice training videos.
,assessment end bit far training maybe also question knowing data practice assessments.
,"course extremely helpful,4 start that.only assignments along sample data measure range learning much helpful."
,"es una excelente introducci籀n al uso de sql para consultas sencillas, uniones, etc...me encant籀 la verdad, un excelente trabajo por parte de los organizadores."
,goor refresher basic start.
,"personally found use http://www.sqlitetutorial.net hepful course, slides."
,perhaps missed elaborate query examples devote time creation reading (external) databases.
,"es un gran curso, ideal para iniciar, adem獺s de proporcionar un punto de vista inicial sobre como se involucra sql la ciencia de datos"
,surprisingly good teaching.
,course well structured felt like got solid foundation using sql query building.
,could able solve problems even writing correct syntax queries.
,"however, instructor fantastic teaching"
,"think allow audit people also look quiz results, good course really enjoy learning"
,course good data science.
,"would good add concepts like store procedures, functions index .. etc"
,course helped understand basic concepts sql required good data scientist.
,slides wrong.
,info need updated.
,q/a based exactly instructor said.
,provide vedio use sandbox complitet homework better.
,overall real help!
,"direct, examples, might challenge newcomers fully understand concepts"
,"good enough basic idea sql is, enough skill apply sql real life."
,would good little examples coding exercices course assimilate better.
,questions added quizes.
,"quiz every week could divided simple, medium hard quiz."
,good beginners feel like missing lot function necessary fully learn sql.
,"nice course starters, would much better exercises, given datasets."
,hope could use popular sql tools.
,like mysql.
,syntax sql lite quite weird
,typos/unclear verbage final assignment need addressed
,great beginners intermediate even professionals missed basics
,feedback add examples introducing new syntax.
,content comprehensive detailed.
,"would recommend others,"
,"great course, although final peer-reviewed assignment seems little bit odd."
,basic overview sql querying - necessarily data science specific.
,part 2 3 peer-graded assignment fine.
,good course basic understanding sql data science.
,week 3 clear all.
,3 weeks well explained.
,really opened eyes field data science
,helpful covering basics sql.
,learn sql basics course.
,could clearer many aspects
,good beginners data science
,waiting peer review pain
,best beginers
,
,need
,lectures fantastic final course project nightmare poorly worded spend long time trying figure questions meant could attempt answer them.
,"also database restricted 10,000 rows meant trying answer questions relevant results queries much."
,resulted even wasted time.
,mentor help forum actually useful - people asked questions based issues responses help.
,"interface, video demonstrations, lectures good; however, lot information; hard go back review information unless re-watch videos; handouts notes reference."
,quizzes assignments difficult complete due errors quiz content.
,needs glossary terms learner reference quiz.
,"i'm week 3, maybe remaining weeks get easier i've practice sql syntax little bit."
,course cover basic topics times feels shallow fast.
,massive gap quality tutorials difficulty graded quizzes.
,resort hours study outside coursera using different resources help complete assignments.
,far thorough free courses youtube.
,"mostly course intended review, that's say, need prior knowledge sql want make it."
,"beginner, recommend though, lot things remain unspoken important."
,"readings okay, humble opinion fall short sql world really offer."
,"this, consider mainly sneak-peak."
,good course could better.
,beginners find hard understand mrs. sadie actually means lectures missing examples better understand.
,found prompt reading teacher bit flustered made difficult grasp wants convey.
,mean rude personal experience.
,first 2 weeks fine though.
,"reason give class 5 stars final project horribly organized difficult - test ability use sql solve data science problems, ability figure instructor wants."
,"besides that, lectures great engaging (and short, can't get burned out), sql fun use!"
,course good introduction sql application data science.
,complex concepts joins thought explained examples provided course assumed someone good understanding concepts quizzes final project lightly touched upon course.
,course bad structured - rule simple complex respected.
,focuses theoretical knowledge.
,suitable beginners familiarize sql.
,"recommend read book: ""beginning sql server 2005 programming"" (by robert vieira) - best starting sql ""world""."
,lectures alright.
,describe basics albeit high level way.
,"programming questions, especially final exam, kind confusing poorly worded."
,seem much way connective tissue lectures tests.
,feel course strongly lacks explaining commands real code sessions.
,sat watching lecturer's explanations purpose commands without coding becomes little boring may turn doubts programming assingments.
,basic sql course.
,"i'm sure called ""sql data science"" catchy title."
,took course refresh sql skills.
,"give idea weak, feel achieved objective."
,el curso fue muy b獺sico.
,en mi opini籀n hubiera sido mejor si los contenidos de las semanas 3 4 fueran m獺s pr獺cticos.
,"las preguntas del examen final ten穩an una redacci籀n muy pobre ambigua, hab穩a mentores encargados de solucionar dudas."
,biggest issue lack practice .
,try stack lot things ask quiz end week mean practice.
,coding word way atleast could given practice every lesson.
,helpful information instructor awkward pretty distracting.
,get reading script seem like rehearsed sometimes difficult follow her.
,practice examples all.
,"videos theorethical queries without results, can`t see works practice."
,reference steckoverflow awesome.
,pay money nothing?
,thought instructor could gone material detail showing real time examples sql.
,would super helpful.
,"also, quizzes much difficult"
,final assignment confusing.
,often quizes taught course material.
,would better course videos examples outputs rather mostly theory.
,there's significant amount hand-holding right final exam requires superior cognitive leap overcome far-beyond-beginner questions reasoning.
,caveat emptor!
,strongly suggest adding example code running result make sense beginner.
,exercise problems current quiz cover points lecture.
,"ok, great."
,directions confusing ending assignment unclear directions.
,example syntax specific instructions would helpful.
,think enough examples help students learn syntaxes deeply.
,seems examples students code simultaneously help more.
,topics well explained videos monotonus (slides teacher talking).
,think course could interactive.
,say course beginners misnomer.
,think one familiarity another programming language yes - could beginner course.
,came course zero formal programming knowledge completely overwhelmed pace material.
,"course give students any/enough ""small wins"" build muscle memory gain confidence."
,drawn assumed time completion.
,"4-8 hours/week sounded pretty good schedule working adult, however 10-minute ""assignments"" consistently took 6+ hours (most time spent calling/screen-sharing developer friend help)."
,"again, think one already programming knowledge (and therefore *really* 'beginner') yes, would probably take amount time."
,"folded almost end week 2. echo another review here, seems instructors forgot like beginner."
,instructors assume much students know.
,really kicking spending money trying limp course.
,"like starting without experience, plenty alternative free material actually geared towards 'beginners' give context practice needed actually comprehend course material."
,"started course, way head."
,"clearly marked intermediate, advanced marked people already industry."
,disappointing me.
,"chose course learn fundamentals java, really everything motivating."
,"lessons short kept easy informative, assignments things never mentioned anywhere, spend hours research online assignments."
,"that's wanted visit course, hours frustrating online research also learning"
,really poor course structure material explanations.
,canceling subscription.
,oop courses easier follow & execute assignments.
,java editor used class clunky ridiculous assignment instructions seem date disorganized - class infuriating.
,takes simple assignments obfuscates instructions.
,literally one worst courses i've ever seen twenty years studying.
,"evaluation (correction check) assignments, reading material provided instructors (except two million free websites refer makes course pointless.)."
,believe course meant make money least contribution.
,regret paid one month course.
,"want know helpful course be, may take look course ""python classes inheritance"" university michigan."
,"course: 1-has step step reading material, 2-benefits online python interface could used assignments quizzes."
,"course taught like beginner level, assignments like phd level."
,"need read sources, depth, solve assignments."
,really beginners.
,"first week ok , spend much time coding."
,really difficult follow.
,"great course, help background knowledge another language doable without any."
,goes fun projects also work usable items csv parsing.
,i'm glad i've found amazing course!
,course huge disappointment.
,impossible start first assignment due lack information examples kind.
,many students posted issue discussion forum receiving answers mentors.
,specific class extremely frustrating huge waste time.
,one thinks this!!!!!
,someone fix class loose lot subscriptions students frustrated!!!!
,way practice assignments written confusing misleading times.
,please improve writing style.
,takes time understand written instructions mean.
,difficult complete assignments otherwise!
,instruction first week quite basic taught learner little actually write code java.
,"however assignments, scarcely reflect instruction, dive code taught write, level well beyond reasonable estimation true beginner."
,assignment instructions somewhat confusing necessary resources scattered there.
,"first quiz reflected homework, likewise beyond anything actually taught."
,"well, resources gathered there."
,"discussion board rife complaints echoing wrote, well complaints basic course design organization problems."
,"complaints ongoing issue, stretch almost year back."
,"unless fair hand programming related language already, would sign course."
,fiish course.
,"hard, exhausting interesting."
,good java tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbwx97e1e9g&list=ple7e8b7f4856c9b19 followed two videos i'm learning way.
,left course ammount time required high.
,"example, one part exercise spent total 12 hours distributed 3 days."
,part exercise spent 1 hour.
,"also, part one, last exercise tremendouly difficult begginers someone (my case) know one language."
,making people hate java.
,begginers.
,say part codepen html great.
,"fortunatelly, pay."
,think paying course waste money.
,"good experience coursera programming course: ""an introduction interactive programming python"" rice unviersity."
,"examples awesome tests reasonable, quite opposite course."
,"also, eclipse much better bluej many ways, also learning... there's things must improved, time money."
,i'm dissapointed course duke univeristy.
,impossible download anything resources website
,teached bluej tough understand
,"really liked course mainly due providing clear vision sub tasks needed solve programme development; liked much solution started problem statement analysing; helps set good practice problem solving decision making: digging implementation one must understand task; analyse get involved needed say job done find solution, implement check implemented solution intended do; thank much clarifying"
,instructors great job introducing java beginner.
,run mill small programming assignments might find average course.
,end course -- complete mini-project -- get confidence know programming program high level.
,everything explained simple tests challenging completely referenced chapter.
,long pay attention review anything get first time around.
,believe anyone take course get excellent understanding programming java object oriented programming.

,""")"
,
,usual 4 professors(presenters) done excellent job.
,"resources, videos, assignments quizzes helpful, well thought comprehensive."
,done enormous amount work.
,seem problems import edu.duke.
,* due installation problems (e.g.
,windows 10).
,maybe include 3 videos like:( example coursera courses e.g.
,r programming) installing bluej mac installing bluej windows installing bluej (mac) ; including would enable give rating 5 stars.
,beginner programmer would help lot.
,know discussions forum (very helpful) students must sweat bit get bluej work messy operating systems comment beta tester
,really enjoyed coursework class.
,"particular, loved challenging assignments were."
,"however, hate cannot submit final quiz answers without paying course."
,also like little help seemed offered individuals forum regarding issues facing code (specifically genefinder project).
,took three courses michigan working python completely open complete without payment (which means opt get verified certificate).
,"wish course, specialization part of, fell category."
,"one sugest瓊o teaching use fileresource,urlresource, directoryresource, pixel, imageresource, etc, without using edu.duke, real word don? use library."
,"know library facilitate coding, students use another ide, coding used course."
,"love course structure, simple."
,"teachers start simple concepts eventually solve real life problems, sound complex otherwise."
,good course quite unique approach... could interesting fun!
,video presentation geeky times.
,course helpful computer science students.
,helps us improve programming skills java.
,cool need focus use grey stuff.... harder neurobiology 1 & 2
,practical short course learn basics java programming.
,phenomena teaching good logic development practice exercise good .
,
,need explain clearly.
,overall course great beginners first wrote program.
,muy buen curso para comprender mejorar las estructuras de java
,good course taking consideration first week
,lesss... :( want pay pass quiz
,excellent teaching awsome faculty.
,better course edx
,
,good 1
,
,warning: complete beginner level course.
,"see good intention java course instructors, exercises could really challenging."
,passing throught week 1 feels like real challenge.
,"experience javascript python made several courses coursera, say sure learning curve course really high: first learning variables next handle data external source execute calling java function bluej environment (first week)."
,"beginner course give confidence handle well programmming language time time let try things language, simply trow complex problem see handle (because learning course, suppose guide future problems)."
,give 3 points well made explaining scope deeper.
,"staff course really nice, that's best part it."
,"unfortunately, opinion course intended real beginners."
,class one struggled trying understand going on.
,"may instead using typical ide like eclipse netbeans, use bluejay, works different rest ides."
,"addition, programs used course pretty confusing (if know 0 java)."
,"learned basic concepts (classes, methods) whole week 1 single 15 minute video-course youtube without struggling."
,"mentioned applies total newbie, already know java think fine."
,nice course people starting program feel power writing software solving real world problems.
,assignments posted challenging enough shed light reasoning necessary write working software.
,"encourage create custom methods help keep code clean, sometimes solving assignments following instructions led many 'for' 'if' nests made code difficult read boring write."
,really dont need course.
,wanted take free trial 7 days checked charged 76 month.
,really need refund.
,one day trial ended.
,please leave reply.
,email: aroy3452@gmail.com
,i'm disappointed true beginner course.
,please note 10000% expected know basics java loss.
,"trying use refresher, still work."
,"content good use 3rd party java libraries, standard one makes pretty much useless get learn anything java programming."
,techniques understand took long time .
,presentation good
,course using packages also working try innovative
,java mastercalss udemy much practical.
,learned much here.
,"programmed java, java libraries used solve problems."
,bit complicated beginner.
,slow pace long dialogues.
,absolutely beginners
,course made want stop coding.
,"i've done courses coursera learned much, specialization, find dreading every single week ""learning"" assignments."
,"java that's making bad, way duke teaches: first, course says previous java knowledge necessary, though week 1, clearly case."
,literally teach proper syntax get started.
,"buy ""mastering java"" amazon get base level knowledge."
,"second, 25% duke's weekly assignments stuff gone over."
,"fine struggle, that's part learning, jump what's covered lesson final task weekly assignment goes frustrating say least."
,"programming languages give mercy syntax errors, learned syntax something assigned, gets painful quickly there's way original assignment/request random begin sure final output be, therefore can't figure own."
,"lastly, estimated time takes complete assignment way off."
,i've done plenty courses coursera usually overestimate long assignments take.
,duke drastically underestimates it.
,every week's assignment supposedly takes 10 minutes.
,know i'm every assignment takes least 1-1.5 hrs random stuff want do.
,"hoped duke's nonsense stopped javascript course (yes, assigned javascript java specialization."
,first red flag).
,"sanity's sake, i'm withdrawing course avoid course led duke university."
,"far fairly disappointed course, spends much time simple concepts skips really important ones."
,"hoping 'university' level quality class, instead find listing instructors talk subjects hardly related quiz lab work content be, time comes work lab quiz portions class, find knowing asking research try figure answers opposed feeling least 'taught' material preparation quiz lab."
,"video instructors knowledgeable, like challenge assignments."
,recently got stuck assignment went discussion forum help.
,response moderators peers.
,plus codesnippet tool post code forum absolute crap.
,format code even written line line.
,fruitless trying search help outside course far well.
,lots wasted time.
,"really want finish class, doubt ever waste money duke\java classes again."
,go elsewhere.
,"however, without husband's help (who senior software engineer), i'm sure could not."
,course surely beginner.
,"though taken c++ course community college before, still found course hard."
,"lesson seems short, simple easy understand, assignments (reading quizzes) crazy little reference document clear instruction."
,"time, spent around 5 hours assignment, 10 minutes allocated."
,"lecturers go loads depth, great."
,"instead smaller assignments though, think 2 quizzes far assignment testing every single thing far."
,"learning, need able chew away gradually everything lumped one go."
,"concepts alone beginner level, need prior coding experience able follow properly."
,would class beginner course.
,content advanced new coding.
,wish read reviews enrolling.
,course 2 one specialism course 1 another within coursera seem right.
,think course 2 right level speed needs adjusted.
,also think exercise timings indicating 15 minutes actual work takes lot longer.
,course good learn solve problems programming.
,course instructors also good understandable.
,"learn java specifically, suggest course anyone course totally based user defined functions provided duke university."
,can't used ides bluej.
,"so, like learning use functions learning actual java library."
,"wished spent time learning basic walk project attributes, methods constructors reason used them."
,"also clarifying object oriented method instead feel like curse assumed already knew focused solving problem teaching easier stuffed like and, or, for."
,could get first week.
,way much emphasis bluej duke university specific libraries.
,already decent foundation coding took course idea could get refresher java.
,beginner way better courses there.
,course place could see confusing someone picking programming.
,much help poor explanation.
,every professor uses little tricks methods material flow well together.
,seems like assume remember every single concept start give useful tips proceed learning experiences.
,ended taking way time said schedule.
,online course cannot expect us learn practise without little theory.
,assigments incorporated things know explained enough.
,regular following like real course learn everything theory put practise learnt there.
,data set genome studies large mine - judging forums - others computers memory compile.
,made exercises/tests difficult complete.
,"also, tests seemed best unclear questions worst plain wrong."
,&-:
,"actually enrolled course intension learn java programming basis.but dont get concept class,interface,oop etc.this course help write simple program."
,i'm unable understand tutor language... feel like going fast i'm unable catch them.
,sorry want continue course anymore.
,"would better java taught scratch syntax semantics, instead using bluej external packages first instant only."
,way repetitive.
,gets extremely boring basically tasks strings again.
,more.
,great assignments lectures.
,low score workload excessively high overwhelming novice programmers
,"course really hard, alot trouble understanding it."
,"overall, one best courses taken."
,good course java.
,introduction week 1 taught roughly.
,think helpful enough.
,tells lots basic things.
,"hard get help, beginner friendly.."
,course cover java basics
,lessons easy catch beginner
,videos okay.
,could explanatory.
,nobody help ide problems!
,really want know people giving course glowing reviews real people taken programming courses coursera.
,"i've done bunch, may worst one i've seen."
,definitely accessible beginners.
,"can't already program well another language, unintelligible you."
,lectures super easy follow written like designed audiences small children.
,"soon go try assignments, notice difficult watching videos (even multiple times) nothing prepare doing."
,even first exercise brutally hard already know respect object oriented programmings patterns.
,give big file prewritten functions expect able write several functions solve increasingly complex problems based methods custom class.
,there's good chance look stare blankly nothing prepares expected do.
,"big issue can't get although sort stumble way things, feel like course explains things work way do."
,[insert whatever task]?
,idea really.
,"realize idea going on, go forum notice every question asked multiple people already, often going back several years."
,obvious nobody maintains looks discussion forums.
,"everyone else pointed out, worth saying again: bluej terrible."
,one earth would force people use ide nobody else uses?
,forced use bluej alone reason finish course.
,it--it's awful.
,also think terrible write custom classes course make course completely dependent them.
,courses this?
,literally makes useless outside class.
,corse horrible.
,tried hard months grasp concepts learn pace required.
,"however, even small amount programming experience, courses made little sense."
,"also, duration courses way off, work full time job, excited taking class free time work hour two weekends."
,"however, found set aside least 3-4 hours day accomplish tasks try squeeze information instructional videos there."
,"instructors overcomplicate topics, speaking tone talking children."
,"information mentioned could find anywhere else online, stuck trying take notes readings videos, get quiz nothing lines taught."
,"attempt teach ground up, however, jump around topic topic impossible feel like actually building previously learned."
,"even felt like understood information, quizzes made feel like complete failure questions answers vague."
,came udemy thinking courses better produced easier understand.
,man wrong.
,videos look dated (when videos made?
,"10 years ago), ide make use looks like made 90s."
,"instructors explain anything detail, leaving feeling even confused video started."
,videos 5 minutes long instructor rushes topic almost like want it.
,"readings, one learns coding reading."
,"even did, lectures force students read almost different language."
,"need dictionary youtube videos explain i'm reading, failed goal teaching."
,"expect pay $50 month course, expect better quality production find free youtube."
,"anyone reading this.... save money find free stuff youtube, pay $12-15 udemy get better lectures there."
,anyone made video...do better!
,low quality crap people get demoralized want learn code give up.
,problem instructions errors incomplete.
,saw students 2-4 years ago asked questions asking recently 1-2 months ago.
,think course staff missed opportunity improve documentation learning experience.
,moreover problem statements assignments vague ambiguous left scratching head browsing forum posts figure went wrong.
,"sorry say, overall frustrating experience."
,"challenge problem solving & coding be, trying untangle confusing incomplete assignment descriptions."
,constant mistakes appear lecture especially reading materials.
,mislead students.
,"example:""as always, you?e done writing code getlargestside method, remember add code call getlargestside method testperimeter method add code system print output (the way last exercise)."
,"always, great time compile test code, run code using example1.txt shape file, longest side 5.0."""
,think answer 5. mentor please double check.
,ps i've found several mistakes class.
,needs improved.
,"beginner's course questions easy staff rated, think good course intermediate people."
,answer quizzes section might investigate lot.
,got life too!
,many us school anymore job family.
,"recommendation, please explain little programming structures like csvparses list something?"
,never got it.
,"pd: way use tricky questions good improve programming skills, please put hint least i.e. """
,"number boys' names file yob1905.csv?"""
,can't understand instructors make simple concepts difficult understand.
,"take example functions video, need nesting function, calling function inside function explaining function first time."
,god sake course required programming knowledge.
,learned programming (10 years ago) yet feeling difficulty understand complex definition explanation simple language concepts.
,course sake duke certificate otherwise give course 1 star.
,course terrible.
,leaves impression unfinished.
,there's lot knowledge missed lectures expected student quizzes.
,lecturers vague understanding java works code real life.
,say lectures misleading gives either false insufficient understanding certain mechanisms.
,examples overcomplicated.
,demand full concentration domain knowledge rather programming itself.
,"bad organized, many typos, errors, uncleared illogic things assignments."
,"almost end, really quitting stuff."
,"liked programming c duke, one total mess."
,"instructors teaching staff talk forums, mentors, big help, course total left alone authors."
,"andy hilton good guy, read discussions correct errors!"
,"like difficulty course, challenging."
,"however, course materials lot minor errors cost time find right files use quiz, least week 1. also happened last class html,css, java."
,"took least hour try debug codes turned reading guide consistent codes provided, caused failure."
,beginning (course 1 java specialization) promissing fast concepts became understandable.
,course inconsistent comes javascript.
,"instead giving fundamentals language, course instructors prefer give bunch non-standard libraries teach couple randomly selected methods could applied images."
,"core concepts data types, data structures explained sketchy."
,oop paradigm isn;t explained all.
,"example, give line code goes something like: var x = new simpleimage(""...""); explanation simpleimage given neither taught exactly works."
,"apparently, course relies heavily self-learning lib docs given site."
,together leads simply monkey-coping lecture materials code editor without even realising works does.
,course best serve observatory purpose give student peek web development like.
,course could used solid foundation fow specialization.
,"enough coverage fundamental programming concepts, much playing around complex application concepts steganography."
,simple image manipulation good way teach programming concepts.
,teaching bit arithmetic first programming course not.
,"also, many errors videos corrected."
,"finally, course advertised requiring 3-5 hours per week."
,huge underestimate!
,"programming professionally since 1989. week 1, every week requires closer 8-10 hours least."
,"stop advertising beginning course, restructure appropriate beginners."
,"first week course great, second week huge leap terms expectations exercises."
,"enough instruction enable learner exercises, leaving feeling demotivated."
,"i'm switching back course lynda.com instead, must thorough."
,first course taking coursera.org.
,valuable instructors duke university designed created masterpiece learners.
,thank much guys.
,"greets istanbul, turkey."
,helpful building websites excellent course beginners even people never coded before.
,insightful helped learn basics computer science.
,i'm able better understand jargon computer science discuss others even review codes.
,"course first course courser's java programming specialization, however, uses javascript teach high level programming concepts."
,"want learn javascript, course you."
,"want learn java, course you."
,course mainly solves image manipulation problems duke's proprietary javascript ide.
,"details ""black boxed"" can't see what's javascript functions."
,believe wrong way teach newbies much abstraction never good.
,"also, man, personally offended professor susan rodger saying wanted see women programming."
,woman means less men sexist.
,"supporter equal opportunity, duke university take disciplinary action professor rodger."
,financially support university allows faculty express inappropriate personal ideology classroom setting.
,"recommend course, course professor susan rodger."
,first coursera course i've ever done impressed platform presented.
,experience positive one definitely continue pursue courses.
,instructors also give contacts let students contact discussion forums dont work
,help discussion forums all.
,giant complete waste time.
,"$79, 1 month work javascript, java."
,"worse yet, required work bluej, (google it) custom javascript functions allowed view use outside course."
,"so, none code write course ever able used anywhere else."
,"(the functions probably minified file, students given access file.)"
,would give zero stars can't submit rating without giving one star.
,everything tested taught.
,example week 2 never learned add filters pictures questions related asked graded quiz try its.
,recommend taking cause.
,felt examples could help someone understand better way.the videos good simple easy understand text.
,i've learning javascript lots different online courses last 2 years first one presented information way could understand it.
,"tutors reading teleprompter comes across robotic, lifeless boring."
,"told piece work submit upgrading, afterwards!"
,completing optional assignments key developing proficiency.
,course provides many resources continuing study.
,worthwhile course want learn front-end web development.
,"course amazing, main thing way teaching makes course interesting amazing."
,loved course looking forward learn exciting programs.
,course good introduction learning program website.
,"yet feel though know enough build complex website, familiar website components make basic website."
,"videos short, get bored watching them, script written video, read lesson, helped process difficult concepts."
,learned projects/ exercises.
,"giving problems student write code for, makes learner actually apply information video."
,"(i don' get online learning courses show video video, problems given."
,one those.)
,"also enjoy short quizzes, solidify understanding concepts."
,(you take quizzes fail!)
,"course well presented, projects students get hands learning coding make website."
,"way learn code, coding!"
,watch video alone.
,took much longer thought would scheduling time take course finding errors something work correctly.
,would recommend anyone would like learn basics web design.
,instructions great.
,word spoken important.
,"listen well, listen practice."
,"recommendation would explain certain function, principle theory also give real world examples function commonly used daily web services."
,"thank giving opportunity learn new thing..totally recommended learn programming..easy understand someone like zero knowledge html,css javascript"
,"great re-introduction coding concepts, learning basics web design."
,thank duke work make great course!
,"construct clear background knowledge programming, learn logically think programming, practice javascript, html, css step step."
,examples similar projects assignments available always would help.
,several times stuck something one gotten stuck couple weeks
,excellent course easy follow comprehend.
,everything beginner needs.
,wonderful teachers good content.
,"great experience,great starty towards fun programming playing javascript modify images"
,personally think course beginner friendly all..... first week nice slow week 2 blasted face moving fast hard grasp once.
,feel like need take courses first come back one.
,started course knew virtually nothing js bit html css.
,"short-term goal grasp basics front end programming i'm working business developer software house communicate effectively fellow developers, medium-term intent create website scratch."
,"lecture pace perfectly tailored routine, half hour day monday friday sleeping hour half weekend."
,"professors well-skilled they've presented content clear easily understood manner, even though comfortable camera lack ""acting"" skills, expect computer engineers steve jobs public speaking."
,"programming tools, learning materials, course ui practical attractive everything click away i've never felt something redundant unclear, good job blue devils, thank making easier first step world everything number (even colors) building blocks functional responsive websites variables, methods, functions, algorithms, attributes, classes, divisions, canvases, event handlers, pixel coordinates, etc."
,"oh, yes, one biggest takeaways, something i'll definitely use explaining importance price behind analysis design aspects services: work mf'ing example hand know need start writing code, start asap debugging everything want ;) cheers,"
,"good class, enjoying"
,says beginners course need prior knowledge.
,true.
,i'm beginner prior knowledge found course extremely difficult follow.
,"videos ""dumb"" enough me, ""try it's"" hard found figure write code telling ""try it's"" resources keep referring back video, find helpful."
,"seek external help programs people(not forums, useless many people questions seem good, working, useful answers)."
,frustrating course.
,"would like finish 4 parts specialization wait come back take course get better understand write javascript, css html."
,explain things well comes javascript.
,expect jump start coding without telling it.
,pass tests assignments know watching lectures reading material several times.
,things like easy pick things quickly get concepts quit course.
,way easy.
,"would say one completes course, still absolutely ability get real web development work."
,"jquery, iifes, almost javascript application besides simplest functions, layout instructions, css style conventions, media query."
,'real' method learned insert picture depends duke's server to.
,"learned eight lines java code four weeks, never implemented web application (viz, script actually runs live website)."
,read book instead.
,"cheaper, takes amount time, learn lot more."
,gave star one minimum.
,zero wasted time.
,"definitely course beginners, confusing."
,part javascript real horror beginners even challenging newly programmers!
,"however, looking responses students received mentors, impression mentors behaved contrary title suggestions."
,"mentors guide students learning, however condescending responses mentors giving students discouraging learning."
,"again, mentors this, think worth going responses students receive providing facilitation training mentors appropriate responses, criticism constructive rather destructive, students may struggling code content."
,tried multiple times learn javascript always failed.
,class bridged gap made easy learn.
,great job duke & coursera!
,really enjoy using codepen duke's portal complete assignments.
,unrealistic use real world.
,"secondly, hmtl css felt straightforward."
,"however, javascript felt like entirely new world."
,think lessons extra time taken explain semantics lot slowly methodically done.
,found severely confused large part class last 1/3 course.
,"acknowledge high level syllabus, really designed bring advanced contents although advertised ""for beginners""."
,"really felt like nobody reviewed materials - least thoroughly - and, know, programming can't find error soon become really frustrated, especially beginner."
,"imagine overwhelming feeling realize error instructions, powerpoint slides, video, single period comma really bring unnecessary anxiety waste lot students' time."
,course learn expect care preparing precious materials.
,"top off, numerous times feeling missed explanation would watch re-watch videos carefully, still could figure out."
,know teaching 20% asking 60% assessments supposed productive bring good results.
,programming learn practicing long properly directed.
,"so, advice people considering course is: prepared give 110% course way demanding advertised."
,interactive should.
,really feel lonely journey spending nights trying figure error code.
,"good news forums full people boat lot help students - sometimes, unfortunately, way asking good soul post code, trying hours end."
,maybe error instructions.
,anyone could taught course whole thing scripted.
,"""teachers"" reading prompt instead using actual knowledge actually teach."
,course obsessed javascript library never taught basic javascript foundations principles.
,barely gave needed complete assignments review example code extra functions code listed assignment.
,yet expect know without explaining it.
,cannot recommend course unless specifically trying learn duke universities specific libraries.
,oh dukelearntoprogram.com shows much know doing.
,website's interface user-friendly big mess.
,really show know nothing useability yet suppose teaching foundations programming.
,yet can't even make website functional.
,makes question quality learning duke university represent themselves.
,course misleading lot ways.
,quizzes course beyond impossible.
,"lecture videos give introduction concepts, left figure everything out."
,provide proper tools enable students understand pass.
,"reading lot discussion boards, two types students: 1. like me, never programmed life, cannot figure out, 2. sorts experience write things way advanced ""beginners"" course."
,"favor, seriously research appropriate programs signing one."
,needs structured way better now.
,terrible course ever seen life site.
,"quiz questions, feel like dumb make connection lectures quizzes."
,really wanted learn java coursera seems impossible me.
,focusing rbg values image thingies much making feel uncomfortable quizzes watching lectures main reasons giving 1 star.
,didnt learn thing week 1. week 2 horrible gets worse there.
,"tests/quizzes tell go back videos help understand questions, got wrong."
,videos dont answer anything first place.
,"think figure out, means, try it."
,wouldnt recommend poorly done week 2 is.
,really poor course.
,"rather starting basics, course picks random information work with."
,week 1 information anybody computer knows.
,week 2 really good.
,week 3 4 completely useless.
,rather starting basics jump picture manipulation encoding.
,take class want learn coding.
,concentrated image manipulation would ok wanted build visual websites living.
,want code anything like business applications (like did) course.
,pixel manipulation something interested (in javascript section) found course really boring late pull out.
,many better options learn code.
,videos course confused eventually gave went another website learn supposed learning here.
,asked question forum another student also problem nobody answered me.
,try somewhere else.
,"wanted learn programming, instead found tested rgb combinations building website straight 1998. course scatter although claims beginners, covers programming concepts rather quickly."
,"taken programming classes, would lost."
,cannot use course.
,learning steps two big explained.
,"instead taking us small steps, show bit content (insufficient) expect solving without prior knowledge."
,respect much better course udemy; would expected better teaching skills coursera.
,javascript part course difficult understand enough.
,would like see tutorial.
,want leave
,"prior experience programming consisted several lessons pascal back school 13 years ago, (apart vague if/else memories) started zero experience."
,"found course quite exciting, often challenging, good way."
,"reason, ""peer review grade"" stated course info, thing."
,"might post link webpage classmates review, optional affect grades."
,"complete course, need coding answer quiz questions based that."
,"basically, nobody ever sees code, posting whole programs forums forbidden, grades get come quizzes."
,post piece code stuck though.
,"can't fully approve approach, general course fine."
,"opinion, course might great opportunity decide whether enjoy spending time coding not."
,"almost beginner, experience html css before."
,course introduced entertaining way programming excited starting java.
,really liked short videos cover important things practice.
,"also liked tasks, short fun."
,"things tricky challenging me, like, since helps understand things going detail."
,"however, somebody around help stuck rely forum."
,great woman see female instructor (all instructors great job!).
,almost 40 shy start programming.
,course showed possible learn programming fun.
,can't wait continue specialisation!
,"easy course totally new beginners, would say course beginner intermediate."
,would prefer instructors made examples could make new section approach exercises solve them.
,"true best way learn make research keep trying, time purposes course suggestion would dive bit exercises, time-consuming beginners will/may struggle."
,"overall consider excellent course, informative, give beginner good insight programming research formulate algorithms!"
,definitely encourages continue studying!
,good course teaches many interesting surprising things.
,admit unaware material.
,completely unaware.
,"creating beautiful webpages (html, css), creating modifying images javascript, encrypting decrypting images images !!!"
,ooooh !!!
,unexpected joy !!!
,know someone things himself.
,i'm really happy gone course.
,one thing.
,takes time.
,think time required given information course unreal.
,"anyway wholeheartedly suggest course anyone interested science, computers, energetic enough absorb amazing stuff."
,course provides complete information guidance beginner web designing.
,"unfamiliar programming starting here, mentors teachers provided study material manner helped (a fresh comer) learn html, css js quickly pretty well."
,"month, really learn lot."
,"require good amount self-discipline dedication learning new subject, specially juggling job university student."
,"quality lecture videos, material provided extra learning weekly amount work perfect coaching web designing."
,good luck !!
,"na primeira semana curso, eu pensei em desistir pois achei que curso era muito simples."
,eu n瓊o desisti porque n瓊o gosto de coisas inacabadas.
,fico feliz por n瓊o ter desistido.
,"partir da segunda semana, eu encantei com curso e tanto que ele trouxe de novidades para mim."
,este 矇 melhor curso que j獺 fiz.
,"este curso manteve totalmente focada, dedicada aprender m獺ximo poss穩vel."
,tenho mais de 50 p獺ginas de anota癟繭es relevantes que servir瓊o de apoio para meus pr籀ximos trabalhos.
,parab矇ns aos professores pela dedica癟瓊o e entusiasmo.
,espero rev礙-los em breve!
,muito obrigada por tudo!
,"course first part specialization amazing way learn basics html, css java script."
,"everything done correctly, except flaws instructions may have."
,"sometimes words swapped one another, may cause problems understanding task, read instrucion understanding + go forums, able comprehend material completely :) thank students always help, course instructors!"
,"regards, amelia r."
,far best online course web development.
,difficulty moderately hard good thing.
,course works fundamentals programming computational thinking.
,specifically course really worked algorithms.
,average html css element teaching course.
,really challenging.
,feeling confident this.
,well structured course non trivial exercises challenge keep motivated.
,practice emphasized time.
,exercises nonmandatory grading absolutely neccesary master understanding basic topics.
,course amazing felt like assignments end tough needs knowledge thought videos
,"difficult alone, challenging worth it."
,course challenges problem solving skills.
,"awesome experience taking course, think assignments might need improvements clear overall course worth it, can't wait finish courses, beginner friendly."
,good concepts attempts teaching lot frustration too.
,experience working gui programming quite understand sometimes things work way want... case though lots concepts explained linked together.
,given specific examples without enough reference.
,"learning new things build old, can't say last lesson learned concept x concept y. go figure concept z using concept x without knowledge z. would nice take extra minutes build base know x+y=z."
,never got that.
,lectures fairly informative get chance learn lot new concepts given enough really implement learning time figure usually frustrated want continue.
,first week awesome really enjoyed it.
,webpage turned well easy use javascript added learning became disjointed.
,i'm disappointed get see paid course week 2 first week would taken course.
,"worst thing though found ""try it"" options came learned concept!"
,"would grit struggle fail hours (the time estimates far course) finally decide move on, learn key concept missing taught next lesson!"
,unbelievably frustrating learner.
,"top that, things work duke learn code program reason causing export code refresh page reenter code."
,would spend much time thinking something wrong didn't.
,working codepen problem actually everything correctly files duke website come wasting time trying fix code went forums find coding error duke's side prevents image library working properly.
,provided solution solution work!
,able test something worked hours frustrated.
,"issue added ""try it"" instructions?"
,wasted time.
,forums fairly helpful mentors reply good part explanations; one classmates replied interesting saw one post 20 people reviewed code know working.
,posts saw also showed frustration felt concepts.
,"so, think experience javascript watch videos order without stopping week go back ""try it"" options successful course."
,certainly recommend person without experience would reorder/restructure everything course better learner.
,good experience learn front end development.
,"but, feel course beginner level."
,"could understand concepts prior knowledge, could better clarity topics."
,"discussion forum feels dead, debug code good thing building experience knowledge, defeats whole point discussion forum."
,reading material could improved better readability understandability.
,"wanted complete specialization badly would enhance resume, doubts it."
,enough examples.
,question one answer - ''go forum'' ( seems nobody use).
,theory explanations short compared proposed activities
,begin... 1) i'm sure duke decided javascript course java specialization.
,that's reason took course.
,"i'll never understand decision huge waste time (yes, know could've skipped course, i'm completist want specialization certificate)."
,"2) first two weeks actually pretty good, week 3 wheels fell off."
,lectures assignments started diverge tremendously.
,"normally fine education, even encouraged, give students answers let figure own, buts incredibly frustrating coding languages since precise, also since duke seems want use special library can't check."
,assignments written instructions absolutely clues formatted javascript.
,what?!
,"there's way figure code formatting own, especially special functions library."
,brings point 3.
,"3) get duke uses friendlier coding program library, makes methods i've learned worthless real world."
,bother learning exist anywhere else?
,"overall, dreaded log-in continue course everyday."
,luckily programming languages could keep spirits trudged along javascript.
,hopefully java portion specialization goes much better.
,i's exactly class beginners.
,first half covers html css quite understandable easy.
,"although, might also help class completely html css past, actually know write necessary code."
,second part javascript.
,problem starts (at least me).
,take javascript class past new me.
,professors try explain lectures 10-15 minutes expect write couple programs make project scratch days.
,"sorry, maybe me, got much hour explanation so."
,would highly recommend anyone new javascript take javascript class first start one.
,"no, i'm new programming."
,structure pacing course feel off.
,"lot instances projects seem line taught videos, thereby making tests extremely difficult."
,one projects write algorithm identify/change colors pixels image.
,"interesting, questioned practicality, relevance exercise."
,"algorithms used edit image website, learning write algorithm automates task website relevant?"
,overall class beginners requires certain level programming knowledge starting.
,speaking beginner level good learning css .
,"java script starts course becomes headache , javascript difficult made difficult ."
,instead going basics teach manipulate images .
,every one's interest field .
,improve javascript course .
,ok .
,html css great.
,"javascript confusing teach part code meant, including syntax --- hence unable understand anything week 4, despite listened lectures participated activities."
,wish javascript's structure consistent html css.
,"consistency, easy web design fundamentals advanced javascript explanation videos help series quizzes assignments week 3 lesson 3."
,curriculum poorly organized.
,two-hour youtube course teach much html/css/js 4-week long course.
,least expect able set simple page decent (beginner) layout interactvity finishing course.
,no!
,much time spent little stuff.
,supposedly learn (i know html/css/js already)?
,"html: h1, p, ul, table, input, div (it take fifteen minutes explain) css: color, background-color, border (maybe five minutes enough) js: document.getelementbyid, onclick, onchange, function, classname, loop, (an hour level simplicity) put one two-hour video."
,"understand beginner course, still, could managed much better real world beginner project like simple web page beginner functionality random useless image processor built library."
,i've finished class got certificate suggest class beginners.
,lack lot basic knowledge questions asked get answered.
,mentor class careful start it.
,means teach yourself.
,"great class people know javascript well take refresh, learner."
,"example , new simpleimage() used time function explaination function."
,feel furstrated class.
,"able manage class pass googled lot things, however return knowledge chopped systematical."
,"started , quite went far."
,never take course duke university teachers act upon scenarios way dramatic overkill.
,best way describe acting: cheesy af.
,"also, old lady high pitched voice sounds like would break glass, always turn volume starts speaking."
,students look like internship.
,sound super nervous stumble place.
,cannot follow instruction shaky voice lack eye contact.
,lack genuine behavior proper explanation concepts apalling.
,leave halfway course.
,never duke university.
,"much fake excitement enthusiasm instructors (not them), put much effort acting, ending bad actors instead good (or normal) teachers."
,"technical subject matter expertise sure, learner, cant get past much bad acting course - constant massive distraction learning... feel course produced someone background making cheap entertainment shows tv."
,"bad, course structure could made promising one!"
,"short, many better options there, one recommended!"
,"terrible course, starting week 2. can't beginner course javascript."
,assignments seemed nearly impossible someone experience jacascript.
,lecture videos gave broad generic knowledge variable example assignment asks change picture's pixel colours without explaining works.
,really disheartening course someone never done javascript life.
,even talk devoid charisma instructors were.
,"course started okay, unfortunatly deeper got course realized teachers really understand padagogy."
,tests long caused frustration help reinforce material.
,"course brought back days college wondered professors really knew doing, writing long tests frustrate students show work."
,decided programming time move on.
,cs50 computer science harvard after.
,still get .
,"content similar, much better every way possible."
,"teachers, tools, projects, explanations, everything think of, way better."
,can't think better way teaching it.
,also cheaper.
,week 1 2 useful.
,"beginner, learned lot html css."
,"week 3 big leap javascript, level difficulty reason quit course."
,"concepts well-explained, lot material completing tasks missing."
,please make javascript part simple beginners.
,detailed explaining method.
,"fast time html learner course starts giving assignment ""try it"" first time learner idea doing."
,instruction videos shallow!.
,assuming students pros sign course?
,quit course live specialization begins.
,javascript java.
,course description clearly state javascript taught used draw boxes different colors.
,extremely let course.
,honestly well designed course.
,went videos tests weeks 1 2 found rushing us basics really telling us much.
,"much ""here's introduction tiny detail... go find rest"".."
,please give course name right title people choose properly.
,"searched java programming course says java programming software engineering fundamentals choose open course says javascript, html css ."
,answers quiz exercises match results.
,instructional videos often assume knowledge beginner have.
,probly unable follow steps yo success.
,failed quiz even tested code got positive result.
,"course, starting week 3 beginners all."
,truly new programming would understand nothing java script part course.
,lot people complain issue course.
,course starts well.
,"then, turns processing image course!"
,"end even learn steganography, hide messages inside imagens, usage (according teacher) bypass government censorship ?不?不?不"
,please see programming course like python matlab see lot difference course.
,please improve make mooc.
,instructors overly explain simple concepts talk programming inbetween makes course confusing get lost quiz stuff properly explaiuned
,presentation quite patronising reminiscent 1990s aol adds places.
,content presented dryly without interactivity.
,"signed ""java programming software engineering fundamentals""."
,"instead learning java, class goes javascript/html/css need all."
,lie.
,everything.
,complete week 2 come back watch videos week 3 see dont anything.can imagine ?good job guyz.
,jump javascript great beginners.
,fundamental concepts programming severely need time spent fact glossed quickly.
,poorly structured.
,explanation examples helpful.
,revamp course content video lectures (specially steganography part).
,instructors rushed javascript part.
,"unlike previous sections, section assumes one knows java syntax beforehand."
,teaches outdated ways writing java (i.e.
,using var define variables).
,"super useful, i'm sorry wasted time outdated course."
,dropping javascript course.

,"get good part, please take note this."
,"caution: take course sole purpose learn html, css, js."
,much better comprehensive courses available that.
,good course plan pursue specialization.
,introduces computational thinking skills learn transferable.
,mini-projects fun lot's ways tread road less taken.
,(go wild!
,even limited knowledge js still explore lot.
,scope endless)the learning curve steep consider html cs.
,"lot times, discover html elements css features."
,make sure make good use dltp platform.
,coding interface extremely beginner-friendly allows freedom experiment.
,overall good course anyone looking get started programming (not html/css/js)
,"course gentle, beginner-friendly intro basics programming, via javascript, html, css."
,"thoughts: (1) course focuses ""web"" programming, really much focus principles good web page design anything."
,"web page assignments mostly used ways beginners create ""real"" web pages."
,"(2) think there's good mix videos (which short), quizzes (not long, plenty chances get right), programming assignments (which frequent short, clearly defined parameters)."
,spend vast majority class actually writing programs (which good!).
,"(3) think might room (selectively) introduce ""advanced"" elements html, css, javascript."
,(i'm thinking optional readings something).
,"think course lot offer, felt like true beginner's course."
,many parts could scaffolded teachers smaller practices.
,"felt like, even though understood material got good scores quizes, often asked create functions yet familiar with."
,"opinion, asked practice perform discussed course help resources directed, also explained."
,"course assumes student lot prior knowledge understanding basic programming terms, syntax, math."
,"worth, consider quizes exercises graded."
,"did, however, enjoy course happy progress i've made instructors' guidance."
,loved html css basics.
,couple recommendations javascript part.
,example integrate javascript html page.
,"i.e., small example web page user upload image process would give complete understanding javascript."
,understand specialization java want concentrate js much would helpful.
,steganography example seem bit complicated people new programming.
,"personally loved in-fact found useful program also learn optimal programming courses checked, students seems struggling."
,may want revisit video introducing steganography.
,would still suggest keep part curriculum.
,"programming environments used course probably used real life, used get basics programming.but recommend absolute beginners knowledge computer science whatsoever,someone already knows least one programming language already probably bored semantics, really found useful step step explanation solve programming problems, without using block scheme intuition.no teacher ever explained detail before."
,"heard cutting steganography project, adding something optional, actually fun, hiding images images, though spy, sending message would save world...but,laughs aside,it felt like something practical."
,"good introductory course web development programming, ready challenges completely (which quite fun practical, imho) pull book two understand concepts theory taught - least that's undrestand all!"
,:p gave course 4 5 stars - find readings materials myself.
,"find resources practical enough, maybe i'm brightest there, mileage may vary."
,":d finishing course like going html, css, javascript individually set good stage learning help truly understand three relate one another."
,"instructors great, videos engaging, challenges...challenging!"
,":p go it, regret it!"
,"solid, concrete course video tutorials lectures focus web page programming."
,"little slow prepared desighned, still good course."
,"courses there, room improvement, feel many principles relevant information effectively explained depth vital crucial helping learners understand new content theory."
,"thank course, good university, good tutorials, good content, progressing course took far greater estimated amount stated beginning, misleading frustrating, impossible differentiate wether slow content adequately transfering information productively."
,"html, css js materials covered made easy understand."
,codepen write websites cooperate great course.
,quizzes simple found coding practice challenging yet difficult.
,"concern whether materials covered would help build realistic website, say, homepage facebook google."
,"seems though i've finished course, still idea webpages see everyday works, let alone code myself."
,"following courses series focus java, ... way, spending 2-3 hours week finish soon may help forgetting."
,"html, css js seem disconnected make cooperate."
,interesting programming topics selected.
,modifying image something everyone could relate everyone must encountered digital image before.
,use pencode wysiwyg editor makes interactive current.
,"huge improvement plain, boring python platform text editor."
,"instructors facial expression dead, flat-voice delivery makes chore watch."
,think youtube tutorials engage audience makes entertaining watch.
,maybe that's much ask traditional institutional lecture.
,"overall, one best intro programming video watched."
,lessons choice relevant could followed ease.
,learning coding python pluralsight realize much actually picked up.
,bit hesitant take anything coursera trying pluralsight like full time job going well.
,think worth little bit background tech able contextualize information.
,also truly implore people outside exercises one sources along program.
,"able complete free student paying, make sure getting money's worth something else too."
,would first pick learning skills also tell people avoid costs.
,html css sections easy javascript sections hard understand someone never really seen js before.
,might good background knowledge subject extra research outside class something pick right away.
,"javascript one hardest languages understand terms programming, guess that's also normal."
,lot examples first section javascript frustrating.
,"instructors helpful, however, recommend taking advantage forums they're pretty awesome."
,lecturers kept looking away camera (probably prompter slide sure xd) felt unprepared student giving presentation front class/audience.
,website/online ide course - codepen recognizing javascript library simpleimage.js reason although followed given instructions(to include url given lecturers <script> tag).
,"lecturers little less ""dramatic""."
,lecturers explained every part code enlightening meaning syntax every keyword.
,"great introduction javascript, css, html concepts!"
,gave good foundation take programming skills next level.
,"plenty exercises appropriately challenging, help solidify concepts provide practice, also interesting fun."
,biggest criticism provided bit instruction debugging tools.
,"since obvious introductory course scratches surface, would also liked high level overview end session advanced topics, give indication go next javascript."
,"content useful, especially lessons focused applying scientific method computer science."
,"liked fact concepts taught, reviewed end video, solidifying learned."
,find quality videos rather lacking.
,"someone develops online courses living, suggest using two cameras switch two views cut needed prevent jumping leaving mistakes videos."
,"professors definitely seemed nervous, suppose goes away time."
,thank awesome course!
,"pros: 1) structured manner 2) extra /bonus challenges study materials 3) questions intermediate level neither basic advanced cons: 1) want learn html,css, js details you."
,"2) crash course rather basic course 3) definitely people starting learn things, course people want already basic knowledge 4) sometimes code work codepen, prefer environment/online platform"
,"would rate 5 exercises felt way hard figure using resources, rely sources expected would rather course challenges well explained enough examples provided tools understand learning projects supposed work."
,"discussion forum great place go figure things, many times got stuck quickly could find people similar issue times."
,great experience first course online definitely considering taking next one.
,im happy see authors improved course actually showing students integrate js html.
,still can't understand allowed access projects students purchase course.
,several courses @coursera require payment want certificate.
,guess hundreds students would happy see general procedure.
,thanks authors wonderful material.
,im continuing 2nd level specialisation.
,"really enjoyed course, offer regarding construct webpage html, design elements using css, add interactivity users webpage using javascript."
,also really liked end mini project.
,really wish live tutoring something immediate student forum get immediate help code performing soundly tried all.
,"that, highly recommend anyone who's brand new coding/programming general, start here!"
,"overall course great, nice variety topics plenty time complete it."
,"difficulty wise, course difficult, however, sections little bit confusing."
,"specifically regarding javascript portion, instructor videos viewed really help instead caused extensive use outside help."
,"sometimes instructors would seem little bit unprepared presentation well, resulting videos little bit less polished could've been."
,web application developer learned new things here.
,one important things learned steganography.
,new concept i'm glad learnt it.
,"javascript part course must say, poor."
,designed beginners like course mentioned.
,could taught basic javascript stuff instead focusing image manipulation.
,"anyways, great effort teachers!"
,thank teaching us.
,"course, got complete knowledge javascript, html, css."
,"teachers taught work particular website, i.e."
,"codepen.io (which good website doubt) making webpage write html part css part javascript part altogether codepen.io taught make webpages writing html, css, javascript different window panes result comes."
,"know, write 3 parts altogether."
,actual course material great.
,loved stimulation learning explained things never understood webscraping.
,took one star though staff member check discussion blind leading blind.
,seen question coming one ever answering learners look discussion know answer timely manner.
,professors great job explaining many concepts.
,suggestion would make try it!
,"challenges little easier comprehend, concepts use assignments quizzes well explained; go discussion forums sometimes understand really supposed doing."
,"got take course free though, much worth me."
,course complete beginner really know coding is.
,"beginners know basic programming is, loops are,etc."
,"course seems bit fast, every concept explained detail."
,course seems designed specifically last assignment creating web-page.
,"teachers good, resources good understanding things become problem."
,really learning create website.
,"instructors/professors, teaching course, way online classes set up, make easy follow easy understand."
,"expect something like online, right point fluff class type teaching, besides i've always want learn read right behind scene website, instead making powerpoint, understand idea executed."
,"two problems: firstly, teaching assistant moderation help student tuch."
,discussion forum useful.
,"secondly, half course spent image processing projects, would useful one planning acquire skills career image processing."
,"hoping develop skills development websites without much image processing, woiuld best use ones time."
,"decent course introducing js, html css."
,"however, vocational teach much theory, lot practical stuff."
,also challenging.
,"think teaching technologies best way learn computer science, teaching concepts better way."
,"overall though, shoutout coursera sponsoring course duke prepped resources well."
,learn quite bit course.
,good: nice course html js css synchronize basic webpage.
,explanation good super clear.
,"bad: experience programming languages, might feel javascript part bit slow speed."
,note: course general javascript programming.
,talks basics.
,"course data structures js, js works, etc."
,application side.
,"like starting instructor gives knowledge algorithms necessary understand programs work, javascript part also interactive."
,html css part basic week html css one week both.
,"also, would better updated course 2020 lot new things updated html css."
,way proffessors deliver speech amazing lucid manner.
,one-liners questions videos really nice way enhace students mind remains involved keeping him/her bound topic.
,really appreciate efforts proffessors taught students selflessly utmost devotion wihout asking anything return.
,special thanks coursera.
,"however understand javascript treated way separates absolutely web-related applications (it treated general purpose programming language, nowadays, especially node.js came fore, still - primarily web language would better treat such, even rest course focused html css."
,get course put it.
,challenge complete optional assignments outside graded quizzes learn lot.
,another way able ask questions/get help besides discussion forums though.
,posts always responded to.
,maybe could graded portion student respond least five unanswered posts?
,seemed lack little terms continuity.
,mini project seemed require knowledge taught sought outside...which real world situation intention source.
,means might required rely peoples code instead learning write it.
,think probably course evolved time parts become somewhat disconnected
,"great summation three languages, steganography (honors) delightful bonus!"
,"however, would liked work languages perhaps outside codepen.io."
,"great codepen.io is, seeing three action (and could wrong this) less ""batteries included"" environment would also helpful."
,"otherwise, everything explained quite thoroughly!"
,create course beginners.
,enter world programming really fast get overview eeverything ever need future.
,intructor's videos clear precise well guiding ressources amazing !
,finished course feel like much programming basic knowledge.
,can't wait begin next course !
,"learned basic html, css, javascript coding techniques gained foundation (hopefully) make coding classes little easier."
,help forums always accessible search posts previous classes help muddle mistakes.
,"wish ""live help"" chat feature; think would great!"
,"course insightful beginners web development, get overwhelming quickly week 3 4. instructions writing code attempted yet, rainbow filters such, become confusing without instruction."

,meh
,i'm somewhat torn course.
,"one hand, instructors lively, enthusiastic, knowledgeable."
,videos generally well-presented.
,"probably worth stressing: *programming foundations* course, web development foundations course."
,natural stress may javascript aspect.
,"however, even mind, thought instruction unstructured."
,"get philosophy 'let's get students actually something', think time needs spent covering basics, especially css javascript."
,coverage css particular quite limited.
,"also understand desire 'make things easier' students work duke libraries work duke platform, think serious drawback, ultimately limits student outside platform."
,"students learn manipulate image, taught enough general knowledge apply knowledge ways."
,i'd like see shorter exercises build 'muscle memory'.
,"learn lot, expect spend fair amount time going back videos numerous times reading own."
,"think course would better served exercises shorter: build web page, learn basic layout designs, incorporate js."
,"now, think students learn fair amount may able much knowledge, shame."
,"well, think learnt things javascript, html css."
,"however, course focused programming javascript solve real problems."
,"assignments based creation images scratch, modification images hide messages original image."
,really think types assignments help students learn web technology.
,"fact, know professional web programmers use javascript manipulate images cases really necessary."
,i'd change way assignments presented prove students' skills.
,"example, possible assignment could implemention counter web page using javascript creation web page buttons, emerging messages, menus etc."
,"web (googling), lot codes allow funcionalities could used modified students create web page."
,"course give lot information, structure really lacking."
,"enough experience basic javascript python fill lot logical gaps, think would pretty miserable coming complete beginner."
,"start explaining basic concepts building blocks javascript, lot course relies heavily using weird, never-quite-explained methods exist duke's programming library."
,"also, see value using image manipulation grounding programming exercises, gets old quickly!"
,"end, projects laser-focused pixel manipulation duke's methods hard see one might generalize experience javascript whole."
,"course would also really benefit quick graded exercises build muscle/syntax memory, opposed quizzes review projects."
,"course ok, expected more."

,use sources help codeacademy udemy keep up.
,"go loops, conditionals basic c foundation would help."
,"leap html, css javascript massive."
,need relook topics either videos add easier teaching methods.
,took similar one udemy (that free) completed one 10x easier understand closed many loops learning javascript.
,50/50.

,great.. challenging
,get lot learn
,exellent courses
,begginers
,"really understand bluej used, lots free java ides (eclipse, ideaj, etc.)"
,also agree oop things say.
,"see point creating separate class test case, one class every single functional class enough (e.g."
,"need test class called myclass 4 functions, thus make one test class 4 less (or more) test cases."
,especially use junit tests)
,"nice course , programming assignments simplified real world problems."
,helps getting familiar areas applying cs in.

,quizzes time-consuming.
,better give programming assignments.
,"beginner, course going difficult you!"
,discussion forums course quite helpful.
,"ok, big improvement first 2 series"
,poor quizzes little help forum
,foundational course all.
,"stopped course week 1, found various reasons so."
,"pour course, confusing level student be."
,"lecturer goes slides explains happens every line program, without giving context actual c programming language."
,explanations time confusing really add useful information.
,"explanations gives really cryptic (""passing address int &int"" without giving explanation really means."
,course set beginner level).
,tone flow speaking really poor lecture (i make video x1.5 rate feeling speaking normally rate.
,imagine slow speaks).
,"finally, slides presentations one worst came across lecture."
,"hand written slides, shows c program."
,"hand writting really messy, resembling doctor."
,doubt anyone really decipher programs showing.
,"least would expect course, slides informative, neat well written, rather bunch hand written programs put screen."
,"recommend course anybody (either beginner intermediate), better spend week reading ""the c programming language"" dennis richie."
,videos order content faulty.
,"moreover, instructor lazy, sluggish uninterested."
,would like stress prior knowledge coding.
,"said, excited course info mentioned, quote, ""no prior knowledge coding needed course."
,"we'll start beginning."""
,"imagine unpleasant surprise 15 minutes in, get lesson: play video starting 19 seconds follow transcript0:19 we're directory."
,prompt computer iras-air: local directory i'm running called cprograms/w1.
,here's develop code used week 1 class.
,"let's look directory, way see directory terminal, mackintosh terminal window, basically running unix."
,"use unix commands, unix command ls shows files directory."
,"see there's a.out file, there's something called add2.exe these.c files source files code see something like miles.exe, circle.exe, add2.exe."
,previously compiled n2 executable course execute them.
,let's look add2.exe.
,"order execute them, say add2.exe, says input two floats."
,"play video starting 1 minute 58 seconds follow transcript1:58 i'm done, 4.3 6.8 11.1. now, want develop program, let's say want change input floats program input three floats."
,let try that.
,i'm going add3.
,"i'm going call add3.c., vi add3.c."
,command means create file called add3.c.
,"play video starting 2 minutes 44 seconds follow transcript2:44 now, going look much like add2.c."
,"basically frequently cases, i'm going want modify pre-existing file."
,i'll read file vi commands.
,"again, class, i'm going go vi commands notepad commands, going get comfortable using editor."
,netter critical tool almost anything computer.
,"understand little it, get tutorial explains detail editing commands need."
,"understand going on, understand need get another tutorial explain."
,"yes, lack basic facility coding, obvious."
,"but, market course one beginner friendly isn't!"
,successfully completed first three weeks course.
,completed four beginning python programming courses coursera.
,"like those, great course."
,"have, however, decided withdraw course."
,"like programming courses taken, learning curve one gets steep halfway point course."
,"looking remaining material, decided would able complete rest course allotted time."
,"also assessments practice exercises fourth week, hard gauge doing."
,"despite difficulty subject manner, really enjoyed course."
,"professor written book al kelley, _a book c_, helpful course."
,ucsc graduate away school 30 years.
,would recommend course someone currently studying computer science college perhaps recent graduate wishes learn c programming.
,"overall, think definitely programming course worth taking."
,"like many courses, significant time commitment."
,still found course difficult even though plenty time spend it.
,given learning basics c. plan trying another course another learning platform.
,great initial approximation
,totally disorganized definitely beginner friendly.
,prof explain set compiler properly use one order succeed course.
,"nice explainashon u saying basics, meaning u saying everything detail"
,everyone long shot.
,instructor regularly makes references subtle topics introduced yet.
,muddles terminology (e.g.
,"referring using pointer arguments function calls ""call reference""."
,"call reference exists c++, c)."
,"need refresher c, course might fine."
,"prior experience c, class poor introduction."
,unless already understand coding level class proper starting point someone beginning coding journey.
,course dead.
,instructor longer maintains course discussion forum.
,code uploaded assignments.
,cannot understant thingh.
,please explain clearly .
,go watch youtube videos understand topics
,course total time west.
,proper explanation... please change faculty
,professor give information order able properly understand videos.
,search internet find answers things left out.
,pay something get free.
,appears videos snippets real class.

,takes long get assignment reviewed.
,"matter fast complete assignments, matter many assignment review, return wait get reviewed."
,really sucks.
,sorry words really frustrating.
,better must machine reviewing instead humans review one particular course alongside you.
,course probably bit longer go detail certain things.
,"html experience, html5, figured would good beginners course."
,felt final coding assignment bit vague far instructions video.
,"use different tags make page look similar professors layout, exact what's required."
,hope next courses level!
,"two main problems, though: first, autograder bad, much flexible."
,"second, opinion, homework code-based, like final project."
,"could best course html5, autograder pure nightmare."
,there's good chance fail final project technical issues.
,"so, 5 stars content, 0 stars autograder, 3 stars final mark."
,"could great introduciton html pretty basic, something explained properly."
,could better since paying it.
,hope whole package web development better whole.
,liked topics.
,"however, i've liked course review concepts forms types associated: radio buttons, combobox, etc."
,nothing new tags features.
,named introduction html 5. introduction html.

,"may 5 weeks course slow learning, see tags second passes."
,autograder works really bad.
,know fail failed questions.
,peer grader would nice final project.
,lectures assignments questions history internet html.
,although i've finished course good thought.
,clear parts videos stopping style questioning annoying.
,optional reading much useful required.
,"done till week # 2, still coding lesson !"
,coding lessons?

,get bored pretty quickly.
,might try another course
,little coding many talking.
,better learn html 5 youtube videos.
,want continue course anymore.
,sorry.
,could better spread longer duration.
,clear teaching much basilar introduction
,certificate worth
,could useful
,expected learn
,boring...
,easy follow easy understand.
,"however, key typos quizzes final exam causes users lose points."
,example one peer review questions asks webpage contains <ol> clearly example page <ul>.
,correctly answer question contain <ol> supposed taking points away person.
,mistakes like quizzes exams pretty unprofessional.
,like typos slides.
,makes feel bit like course thrown together money grab.
,chaos!
,pure chaos.
,"well structure, jumps topic topic, totally irrelevant way."
,supposed course beginners!
,i'm taking python specialization university.

,grader pattern changed final exam.
,lectures improved.
,whats taught assignments related cases.
,"fully satisfied course.i pause read descripton screen class understand lecturer actully saying.it difficult understand saying,because speed talking.what hear may saying.so toggle screen description everytime annoying"
,"know teachers, everybody hates?"
,honesty seen online instructor disrespectful unmotivated lectures.
,"finished course part specialization want receive, advise somebody make course fun"
,"lot theoretical stuff, nothing practice; awful final exam strategy, course encourages learning heart without thinking; advice: help non english students (like me), make lectures overlapping subtitles"
,"hi, course really good beginners, feel onset, could practice practical coding part course."
,probably assignments would helped.
,el curso puede estar muy bueno pero en la escripcion dice que tiene subtitulos en espa簽ol todo el material de lectura esta en ingles.
,quiero la baja del curso.
,"interested html complete course, please close course deadline please give permission excel skills business: intermediate ii"

,instructor says time & time going bother explain detail go & explore free resources want learn.
,pay class?
,"honestly, save money."
,"nothing rip-off shocked institution like u would allow sloppy, lazy product brand."
,"make matters worse, instructed time & time go onto discussion board ask help want bother explaining concept."
,1. everyone else taking class confused - could possibly help me?
,2. staff comes onto boards rude & unhelpful i've ever seen.
,"literally say ""well, watch lecture?"""
,ummm- yes & directed come help.
,feel duped.
,scam say sorry paid money this.
,"really want learn css, get good book subject and/or utilize free material internet."
,absolutely waste hours time way much money providing.
,professor breaks material better clarify concepts provides ample time practice.
,one thing really liked intentionally made common mistakes (which incidentally made) show would happen & fix it.
,audited course watched videos i'm sure even better quizzes & graded assignments.

,"well, here: ."
,class structure messy .
,"communication skills poor. . know design course examples shown html bad u think u watching course 2002. . teacher says ""frustrating"" many times, uses much negative word towards coding html... maybe hopes desencoraje students empathy end exact opposite."
,"would recommend course, newbies, oldies, anyone searching good learning experience."
,finishing course painfull promised abandond it.
,"unless really desperate take course css, take one elsewhere."
,"course css, totally hands-on, spent mostly talking--with instructor describing effects going be."
,can't see code action?
,"multiple errors course, including typos downright wrong information (such confusing ""active"" ""hover""), corrected, even though students pointed far back 9 months ago writing."
,"thought dr. chuck role course, forget it."

,pretty challenging figure css workflow course class.
,could used bit instruction that.
,using inspect elements super helpful.
,moving html css big jump terms numbers windows needed open number times saving refreshing.
,recommend adding little bit students help set workflow.
,"otherwise, great class!"
,great course sense start scratch able good design.
,"think week 3 assignment (we really play position, transition, etc ...), week 4 light (not lot new stuff, design table assignment)."
,feel lot confidence learning.
,"although assignments little confusing, pushed look external sources validate seek material complete work, pushing use creativity."
,good pace great teaching skills.
,complete novice pretty well understand basics & anticipate reachable.
,5-star though continuity lessons sometimes bit blur.
,"complete videos assignment locked..so this,it shoe course complete..and dont give certificate..please fixed this...i complete task unlock"
,criticism would grading system confusing.
,different selections mutually exclusive difficult evaluate peoples work.
,"great, think grade peers, asked 3 times sometimes assignments grade."
,getting grades also takes bit time.
,course definately challenging new things learn instructor student community well individual learning effort make worthwhile
,"lively, clear, good pace, place personnal work, constant remainder accessibility."
,"however, confusion assignment instructions spoils little flow."
,"peer assignment review mandatory, sometimes annoying delay time receive certificate proceed last module."
,nice course learned new things new implementations doesnot cover every thing css things everyday gets used almost covered
,"helpful learn basic css3, tags, class new me, thank coursera big thanks mrs collen"
,way teaching guidance good much happy learn.
,useful time good opportunity use valuable course....
,"nice course, perhaps little bit little effort required suited schedule point."
,4 stars given much attention think floating postioning.
,"enjoyed course , think assignments animations , transitions(week 03) ."
,easy follow gives well understanding main css3 concepts.
,"lacks responsive design topic, otherwise helped revamp previous knowledge css3"
,"short complete course, practical teorical."
,learnt lot of.
,"good intro course, wish drilling exercises css."
,"really nice, helps lot know nothing css."
,"good html course, nevertheless perfect choice!"
,clear resourceful introduction css
,good course css starter.
,strong introduction css3.
,"great course, made work"
,practical fun course.
,"thanks, learn alot :)"
,"excellent course,."
,"instructional design perspective, course missed lot practice feedback cycles."
,"feel like understand basics css3 taking course, believe learner would advance reach higher level mastery course stronger focus guided practice feedback instead instructor saying, ""i hope go practice this..."" could looked like: instructor briefly introduces new concept related css3 provides html code learner copy/pastes coding software."
,learner writes css code specific things.
,"complete, ""next page"" course could contain sample css code could look like meet given requirements."
,"pattern ""teach, practice, feedback + insight, repeat"" would allowed learner spend course instead learning css (e.g., less video time practice/doing time)."
,course good start already little experience css.
,"neophyte, found much material amount presentation time."
,needed many examples exercises.
,felt dejected time instructor said worry getting right experiment -- that's easy say graded.
,"fact material extensive often complicated, imperative me, student, correct fast possible."
,result grade (a) reflect comprehension material.
,"managed commit material presented short term memory could pass course, always happens someone crams, information gone head."
,course okay introduction css.
,enthusiastic course material explanations generally good.
,"think course could thorough, could use formal coding exercises assessments."
,"content seems little dated (e.g., browser-specific coding, using float rather newer flex simpler reliable)."
,"good overview, detailed definitely beginners - especially due lack personal attention."
,supplement lot material missed resources.
,"still, fairly good overview css3 already little understanding."
,introductory much content actually help learning.
,condensed content would better also intended audience course since previous programming experience.
,missing key examples explanation many terms good try though appreciate effort provide free knowledge.
,course interesting suggest really want build carrer web developing
,think professor good.
,expected dive little details.
,course lacked organizational structure.
,lessons logical progression material jumped around lot.
,"furthermore, topic introduced video lesson, practice correspond lesson learned."
,made hard reinforce learned.
,would recommend course someone experience r.
,"programmed sas (15 years ago), thought experience would sufficient take class."
,say not.
,"class definitely beginners - must programming experience, r experience and/or both."
,programming exercises follow lectures build upon concepts.
,"required seek help elsewhere (i.e., stack overflow) answers questions take days, longer."
,"so, fact classes organized week means conclude time believe will."
,feel class self-taught anything else.
,decided quit class become extremely frustrating.
,material poorly prepares assignment expects deep commitment single part solve it.
,unable find help forums online despite well quizzes work.
,videos difficult follow along due speaker.
,"honestly, i'm disappointed course."
,content taught course accordance assignments.
,like someone taught builder asked build brooklyn bridge ... fair all.
,"going ask build bridge, teach how."
,"teach builder ask wall, bridge."
,"""r programming"" forces dive deep."
,skills serve strong basis rest data science specialization.
,"material depth, presented clearly."
,little explanation program using r constructs would certainly help.
,course suddenly throws us deep ocean hardly experience swimming.
,"lectures engaging, listening someone talk code good way learn it."
,"swirl course better option, basic cases consists copying something that's already screen."
,gap taught lectures assignments absolutely abysmal incredibly frustrating.
,supposed know create complicated functions listening someone say function is?
,"think teaching someone equivalent ""2+2=4"" asking solve riemann's hypothesis exam fair."
,"roger peng regarded one best business comes practicing data science, found instruction skills wanting."
,"someone new r new programming, found somewhat hard follow times."
,"nevertheless, powered through."
,"unfortunately, came quiz end week 2, found drawing background knowledge taught course."
,"honestly, unless starting background programming, would recommend course."
,instructor appears unprepared present material.
,presenting appears first time reviewing material.
,first bad experience coursera.
,"last coursera course took (sql data science university california, davis) great appeared instructor prepared going present."
,coursera needs vet instructors' course recordings allowing put forth material site.
,"excellent course warned, programming assignments difficult."
,"coding experience, assignments may bit challenging you."
,"help internet github, complete problems."
,videos information beginners helpful.
,best part course swirl exercises complete r. swirl exercises acquitted programming needed success r. overall great course.
,understand programming assignments challenging new timers.
,poor material.
,"theoric, interaction, interesting applications examples, boring lectures."
,"material trivial, without real applications."
,assessments useful cases related topic.
,overall evaluation course 1 stas due main two reasons: first course much information without applying weeks.
,however learner opens assignment inevitable face hard tasks spent time youtube sources learn use functions solve assignments comparison course itself.
,reason satisfied course.
,given theory okay applying week less.
,reason learner face big issues quizzes.
,found swirl assignments useful say things learned practical part r programming.
,advice increase number swirl assignments increase difficulty level time.
,also better decrease difficulty level assignments quizzes.
,course theoretical practical teaching.
,assignment requirements practical.
,"expect much... lexical scoping probably used majority data scientists course expects research entirely spend hours hours it, focus could placed somewhere else!"
,"""mentors"" quick respond dissatisfaction course comebacks students ask help regarding assignments nowhere seen."
,"watch lectures, enrol 7 day trial, submit assignment 2 4, ignore rest."
,let trick money!!!
,"(ps like beginning, thought paying course, good job getting certificate, trust me, course worth it.)"
,probably pedagogically inept course ever enrolled on.
,"although content would hope find course, delivery outrageously bad."
,"complete assignment, google becomes best friend rather lecture notes, know something wrong."
,idea baby thrown water may learn swim rather drown pedagogically retarded.
,"unfortunately, seems approach here..."
,gap tutorials assignments huge.
,teach algebra expect calculus.
,got google searching.
,"took long time, frustrating."
,course could better intermediate assignments help close gap.
,i'm sure they've done already.
,"based discussion sections, tell large percentage people quit data science specialization taking course."
,good explain without practice giving examples
,however absolute beginners might challenging assignments videos assume basic knowledge stats programing
,"nice, limited explanation beginners."
,"even though video lectures, discussion forums, swirl & reading resources informative, huge disconnect assignments & taught."
,impractical people introduced r(with background programming) take course.
,graded assignments made simpler preceded smaller ones help first-timers get used coding r. think swirl; even though valuable resource; achieves task remotely.
,difficult follow course curriculum fully line quiz.
,course could easily span 6 weeks avoid information overload unnecessary time pressure working full time family responsibilities.
,optional swirl exercises revisited course 2 course 3 there's little time within week.
,presenter uses undefined/unexplained terms regularly users would familiar with.
,good course need much time announced finish assignments
,really frustrating assignment seems like completely course.
,"given paying course, becomes challenging complete time."
,paying fees second time able complete course time.
,advise bring course charges charge only.
,guys really take reviews seriously please read review find issue gap huge gap assignment lectures.
,course poorly laid out.
,"programming assignments quizzes completely new, much advanced material compared taught lecture."

,"i'm going finish course due number reasons, personal gripes, fatal flaws course itself."
,first gripe obvious lack kind script video instruction.
,"can't tell many times distracted professor simply able speak clear sentence without stuttering least twice saying ""um"" ""uh"" less 10 times points single sentences."
,"obviously sure stuttering problem, tried hardest deal it, however, realizing he's saying videos matching what's lined written lesson knew matter stuttered not, he's simply teaching things asked quiz."
,know reading supposed be.
,"went bought associated book, literally enterely different lesson arc videos line out."
,documentation?
,that's i'm pointed time hate tell someone could learn r syntax worked documentation courses it.
,"so, course goes shaky understanding 1/4 base functions r, writing functions expecting understand remember syntax functions learned cases, look works make happen."
,"guidance than, here's half answer, good luck rest."
,part course absolutely can't stand exercise model swirl came test code.
,"least three times correct answer, spaces register correct, spent hour three questions trying understand wrong wasn't."
,"that, right there, biggest reason i'm going even attempt complete course moving something else hold hand little syntax i'm learning, rather expect understand week."
,hope anyone else attempting course better time it.
,"professor obviously knowledgable language, i'm sure he's good relay information, least wasn't."
,course mixed bag.
,"pros: lecture content useful, albeit bit dry."
,"can't give much slack dryness, coding."
,"however, could shown real-time coding, rather scrolled powerpoints command window pasted."
,definitely need r open following along lectures.
,"quizzes also quite useful, required know background things work use commands learned lecture."
,"cons: assignments assume know lot basic knowledge, there's real way know assignments lectures."
,quizzes tend easy side assignments ramp things quite quickly.
,there's intermediate material test skill.
,worked r even minor chance succeeding assignments.
,"well material really good like fact since supposed beginners use stuff really see explained detail lectures result search long hours web.i understand seeking information part course spending many hours trying figure things really ideal,since people choose distance learning times occupied duties try squeeze courses schedule.i also think amount information especially first week finished much one week someone new subject."
,"currently taking another coursera class 'python beginners' say comprehensive , step step intended beginners."
,"also, great support instructor forum."
,dr. peng colleagues communicate well provide reasonable overview r platform.
,"took class hoping take reasonable prowess stata bring r. biggest gripe course stuck almost entirely program r rather perform statistics r. given historical purpose r described course start using statistics learn additional programming go, approach course seemed little backwards."
,reasonable working understanding r programming language lookout course let apply statistical knowledge working r.
,"course easy like user manual, wish ""why"" ""principles"" inside."
,"important thing know ""why""."
,"eye, ""functional programming principles scala"" kind real course taking (it priority right delay finish while)."
,get sense important feature new language.
,"lots places lecture drones lists functions r context, occasional examples."
,"hard follow, really, find tuning out."
,"so, arriving first quiz realize clue half stuff, go back videos struck exactly droning, listing functions without context saliency."
,"even swirl exercises, felt lecture material great enough context completely grasp concepts."
,"felt like material place times came quizzes, spent time hunting information actually learning material."
,course videos coding assignment disconnected.
,someone like prior coding experience better avoid taking course.
,first learn r enroll.
,many concepts skipped r. hope course upgraded standalone course r beginner expert.
,thinking return course fig r internet continue
,wish function examples go step step explaining construct simple function complex one.
,"felt lacking, refresher guide learned far constructing functions could gone long ways that, even swirl application."
,"finish it, course good."
,"big problem trying upload assigment2 week 3. finally, give difficult follow big amount instructions complete assigment."
,"come on, another way so?."
,"anyway, able finish week 4."
,"useful enough, lacking quite bit terms examples."
,"4 week course, feel though many aspects r course could choose focus on."
,"seems many times focus obscure, areas essential data science track."
,way much focus lexical scoping.
,"quite tough - prior experience python, would completely lost."
,"otherwise, quite steep learning curve material."
,would probably complete segments specialization reviews less stellar
,overall bad course.
,needs tidying though.
,"example, assignments seem assume knowledge functions covered prior lessons."
,"applies textbook, e.g."
,"page 50 refers subset() function, actually covered."
,"felt programming assignments explained well enough, things like different syntax explained such."
,"class required lot outside research included class, mention clearly."
,would better interactive.
,"videos helpful beginner programmer, assignments pretty challenging."
,"still feel like learned something though, mostly swirl pretty cool thing!"
,course good one background programming.
,really challenging come fields.
,"life science background, recommend check r programming courses tailored field."
,"programming experience r, course you, link programming assignments course slides."
,practice assignment proposed beginning course week 2.
,"finding difficult follow, feel like missing chunk information."
,however say everyone else seems managing probably missing something
,"comment content, however, slightly obssessive, way lecturer uses talking, sounds lecturer, made want see text."
,cases felt course lecture (video) bit tough understand things could explained better.
,swirl complemented filled gaps.
,"knowledge needed programming assignment covered lecture, friend spent many hours searching around debugging order figure"
,good course overall assignments little guidance completed easier use material future lessons solve problems
,r programming seeming difficult hour courses required initiated making language better learn among scientific community.
,lectures exercises good.
,somehow assignments related lectures exercises.
,lectures homework quite relevant.
,"instructor explains little programming, assignment tough."
,curso 矇 bem interessante por矇m existem algumas atividades que necessitam de um conhecimento maior que adquirido curso.
,practical beginners.
,probably useful already extensive experience programming languages.
,would request instructors work modules real time similar quizzes.
,"challenging, gives good idea rprogramming, taken learning tools outside coursera"
,"ok instructor always talks fast, stammered lot."
,wish could speak everything fluently.
,good content overall programming assignment requires deeper insights syntax covered
,good still programming problems discussed ease learners dive interest r.
,lectures bit hard follow assignments way harder topics lectures
,"difficult follow exercises, since programming background."
,many text slides.
,video resolution adopted smartphone (asus zenfone 5)
,submissions would take upload accurately.
,resulting errors
,concepts often included assignments material yet taught.
,exercises ae far advanced lectures study materials.
,bit tough professor's rushing course videos.
,quite difficult digest beginner.
,hope examples easier.
,assignments way tough taught lectures
,much stuff taught without teachings basics language
,"okay, explanations mediocre well assignments."
,course videos hard follow.
,swirl package good
,swirl exercise along course makes much sense
,theoretically fine.
,much practical examples used
,assignments difficult without instruction
,"good, need data/videos solve quiz"
,contents basic poorly explained
,good found little theoretical.
,old information nothing motivational
,interesting course - thank you.
,unenroll see option
,pretty short introduction r.
,
,easier way learn r
,straight narrow.
,hard boring
,
,frustrated learner trying write constructive review here.
,studied course full time get certificate put profile.
,"r programming considered nearly essential skill, fundamental, data analysis."
,high hopes going course.
,lecture videos: cannot begin tell many times fell asleep watching video lectures.
,course like listening someone talking pages pages copy/paste text command prompt.
,"i, hand, prefer learning doing."
,"sadly, clumped assignments (more later)."
,"also, dr. peng makes gross burping/drooling noises video time time."
,"apologize sounded rude, try listening lectures headphones say same."
,video editing pre-recorded videos rocket science.
,assignments: biggest frustration throughout course.
,imagine want learn play piano (and play little guitar now) go piano class.
,piano teacher talks ears music theory several hours hangs dry front audience concert hall.
,"protest ""but clue play"", teacher says ""all piano greats learned fiddling around ""hacker"" mentality""."
,"ask ""why pay $50 hack own?"""
,"off-lecture help: take course reason did, thank favorite god moderators discussion forums (mentors)."
,1 2 stars give belongs solely fantastic work do.
,"stickied posts forums offer bit help assignments (not enough, still something)."
,also active answering questions.
,"star review goes ""swirl""."
,learn way swirl exercises watching lectures long way.
,"conclusion, finished course nothing rudimentary understanding r despite fine grades."
,little thought seems put lectures.
,would recommend want show certificate someone.
,"otherwise, stay away!"
,course abstract find rushing videos get practice/quiz trial error way project..... hoping best.
,neither excited starting lesson week real world problem/or data set i'm continuously practicing from.
,lessons essentially reference guide useful approach teaching.
,"wanted reference guide, i'd pick one various handbooks/books markets list r codes functions."
,"better way teach/present course infusing actual, real world examples cases throughout lessons instead listing function talking corresponding activity/response."
,"ideally, real world example would introduced first lesson week 1 data set would used throughout course(s) apply practice newly introduced functions."
,"teaching perspective would likely make concepts much easier grasp importantly, retain."
,"lessons, currently presented, encourage rote memorization rob students actually applying concepts/code taught."
,"also, love idea specialization."
,"however, think professors need work closely online instructional designers make entire series palatable online learning."
,much feels adapted traditional course without help professionals skilled designing online courses.
,"aforementioned case, professor(s) commended efforts, definitely work done make engaging course i'd recommend."
,ps - taking notes experience stata type coding/anaylsis unfamiliar me.
,imagine novices may take lessons.
,reason giving course 2 stars swirl modules awesome.
,swirl main form instruction course.
,"taken one class using r long time ago, basic understanding programming -- total beginner, basically beginner -- found course absolutely impossible using materials provided."
,"quizzes especially coding assignments seemed, part, completely unrelated lecture contents."
,"lectures, turn, contained sorts details needed assignments quizzes often felt lost."
,"lectures generally barren concrete examples sort meaning audience -- example, teaching function, instead showing example actually illustrates we, data scientists, might ever want use function, usage demonstrated simple ultimately meaningless (and therefore forgettable) way."
,would much useful show basic example immediately follow real application.
,"many, many, many functions one seems need memorized, course provided tools help facilitate that, input functions focus on."
,big mess.
,"ended teaching everything googling... ok, guess, taking course, then?"
,"better way usher students process, even goal ultimately get us resourceful find information (like spend time lecture going look everything up?)."
,swirl seriously thing saved it.
,would liked see repetition functions discussed videos slowly build advanced questions quizzes assignments.
,swirl lessons prescriptive.
,"swirl good theory, aids along much really effective."
,recommend adding practice assignments learners particular task independently multiple times different variations really learn we're doing.
,"throughout course, would watch videos, understand everything said, completely lost time assignments."
,"i'd use forums google complete them, felt like disconnect videos assignments made course difficult/time consuming."
,"interim step practice questions (not overly prescriptive package like swirl, one makes use solve problem struggle little bit), think would've really help make course useful."
,"also, something assignment mean committed memory, even though able figure assignments, think i've really retained much info possible."
,"terms grading peer assignments, feel know r well enough taking course say whether someone else's code works (without running assuming match mine exactly)."
,"appreciate time effort must taken set course up, fell short expectations really feel i've gained much (if anything) it."
,prepared.
,lecture portions course quite short basic.
,provide much way practical examples.
,assignments often little lecture topics (week 3 introduces whole new concept learn outside course complete).
,"they're decent assignments, learn them, already lot experience, expect take long time complete."
,guess main problem besides enough emphasis learning foundations.
,introduce subsetting give simple assignments give basic superficial understanding concepts syntax.
,"unfortunately, stuff takes time really sink in, need sit play around hours get good feel it."
,optional assignments could guided exploration topic would super helpful.
,one saving grace lot help forums week.
,mentors best help students generally pretty quick get back ask questions.
,course bad.
,would like say course sucks compared sql course matter structured instructor conducted course.
,instructor boring explain clearly.
,"even start, clearly clarify start use r. talking powerpoint shows."
,absolutely recommend course beginners.
,"(0 star) give little credit swirl, practical tool provided course learn r thought instruction r program itself."
,"later part swirl, confusing sometimes."
,"however, learnt much swirl rather instructor."
,can't understand talking make clear thru using swirl.
,said swirl optional part realized shows much worse swirl.
,"(2 stars) overall, recommend anyone, especially beginners."
,"althought lot learn instructor knows stuff, disappointed course."
,"first, recommend going ahead computer give lecture, except maybe introductions week keep personalized."
,"instructor repeats ""um"", ""uh"", ""so"" far much (2-4 times per sentence) hard focus lecture."
,"second, assignments match material taught, scaffolding."
,ph.d. quantitative sociology eight years statistical coding experience (not r) think thing got assignments.
,i'm sure would completely lost programming experience.
,"makes sense instructor slowly build assignments difficulty, rather throwing students deep end analyzing data 322 different datasets."
,please improve course future students.
,"past experience, know it? easy people take suggestions."
,still want try time.
,"high hopes course, quite disappointed."
,think dr. peng needs improve teaching skills.
,"1. good teaching clear, concise, right point."
,"please slow down, speak."
,don? mumble.
,2. programming practical skill.
,best method learn programming use step-by-step demos.
,talk concept 5 10 minutes still can? get it.
,use demo get right away.
,"3. don? try cover materials think done teaching, try understand students learn make sure really get it."
,"4. haven? covered concept, don? assume students understand magic."
,"good teacher make learning experience effortless fun, poor teacher makes like torture."
,"course ""1-dimensional"" high didactic quality."
,followed several courses ( also python coursera set up) one really disappointed ( i'm wk 2 4 now).
,bit pitty instructor speaks rapid ( ment also non-native us speakers?).
,material hardly explained step step.
,moment: watch video go yuotube find videos deal topics easier didactic better way.
,"examples good cousres opinion stats probabilty course/ python course ps ""all data toolbox"" course seem flaws."
,"course knowledge level low concerning programming ( md, hardly scientific educated...)."
,nevertheless hope feedback good.
,frustrated disconnect lectures programming assignment course.
,"lectures basic, makes sense intro-type course."
,"programming assignments, however, little connection lectures."
,"experience using software command-based interface (including r) statistical analysis, relatively good searching finding information independently, course way hard even me."
,"might revisit programming assignments time experience application, sake completing course, kind find silly need experience r pass course intended people little experience r."
,"lectures professor provides quite clear, practice exercises created course well reinforce lectures."
,"however, assignments impossible little material."
,one taught introductory algebra given calculus problem solve.
,professors designed course need go back review way design assignments ruin course.
,even submitting assignments difficult somehow expect know github works.
,"unless taken r course experienced programmer, would avoid class."
,"first 2 weeks many videos, make difficult follow."
,breaks flow lectures makes lot unuseful repetitions.
,"slides words hard follow, graphs illustrations, means rely voice lecturer guide you, difficult sometimes."
,"furthermore, code presented run 'live', results often lacking, makes comparison 'my results' hard do."
,"summary: bad course (swirl great tool), look another course that's easier follow."
,"course required content learning program r. however, presentations hard understand."
,lot information jumps intermediate level.
,"feel instructors knowledgeable, know teach."
,"need understand teach person read ""cat"" start sounds ""c"" ""a"" ""t"" slowly put sounds together.... say cat says ""cat""."
,"previous experience r & r ""hacker mentality"" thing got course."
,feels like course abandoned instructors.
,programming assignments practically impossible done unless previous programming experience.
,"swirl, would helpful basic optional exercises never programmed before."
,"worked hard able follow it, knew uninvolved instructors were, would saved money spent course active involvement developed it."
,way talking videos erratic.
,looks like always doubt say.
,"speech full ""eeer"" non-completed words."
,"mean fusspot, english mother tongue, key stay engaged."
,script read would probably solve issues.
,"seems great understanding topics explaining, however, able communicate properly results bit failure me."
,i'll maybe try future.
,"although content covered presented clear, logical manner, expectations completing passing coursework/assignments/tests require knowledge is: 1) included training materials/presentations 2) extremely advanced ""beginner"" level (which course described) trying pass week 2 assignment quiz consumed exorbitant unnecessary amount time; going seek training r programming offered another instructor."
,content speed teach r actually good.
,considering pay 45??49$ course expect polished videos quizzes.
,"videos stutters, repetitions filling words."
,seems like rush without decent preparation.
,also one quiz questions simply wrong.
,fixed.
,furthermore commands present deprecated cannot used anymore.
,good intention programming assignments much much harder covered mostly theoretical lectures practical advanced swirl exercises.
,"reading reviews course, struggling complete first programming assignment, canceled."
,"please advertise beginners - think people programming experience would find great, newbie."
,step-wise introduction r novice.
,"useful many respects, uninitiated field need time, slow increments project difficulty thorough, step step explanations."
,"think designers course wrongly assume r programming taught course erroneous; laying foundations, student expand his/her r programming abilities."
,attempt course unless strong foundation programming.
,"although lectures initial quiz sections straightforward step step, get assignments, massive leap concepts commands introduced lectures required."
,also support way getting guidance apart blanket google search.
,hugely dispiriting demotivating.
,tougher class advertised.
,"essentially clear entire week's plans complete first week's assignment, far toughest."
,needs testing variety incoming skill sets.
,"lectures also benefit recalibration, lecturer speaks way fast newbies speaks fastest explaining complex concepts."
,makes tough learn.
,"omg, talk throwing deep end weights feet."
,holy sh!t.
,"course 2 week 2, would way beginner programmer would get pollution project."
,must spent 12 hours trying figure out.
,"functions never seen, script beginner would ever know."
,know long keep up.
,"even swirl head... skip(), skip()... brutal!"
,"came much experience r found lectures swirl practice problems pretty helpful, assignments way difficult understand own."
,"first experience online course knew would teaching myself, felt stuck assignments use google help practically whole assignment."
,introduction r programming... in-depth introduction... week 2 we're asked compute program read multiple files specific functionalities!...
,introduction r programming whatsoever... also requires lot user reading sources i.e.
,"google, stack overflow... etc... recommend newbies"
,"masters degree unrelated field, however, consider intelligent difficult beginning understand."
,"may experience either coding r, completely lost."
,"planning completing data scientist track, decided go back basics discontinue coursera point."
,course difficult grasp.
,"instructor (i believe) assumes participants background programming, since not, difficult time following examples."
,"bought entire series classes, need retake one read sources chance digest what's here."
,"material concepts covered lectures basic simple, without clear exercises practice examples."
,"time solve assignements, overwhelmed you, far advanced confusing compared topics lecture."
,introductory course people without knowledge programming.
,"good explanation regarding topics, rushing missing basics things tell, one thing ""everything ppt explanation practical coding consol"" cant understand unless practical right!"
,rest everthing fine thank you.
,"although interactive exercises interesting go through, teacher bring course fun way."
,expect programming course lectures practical course teacher goes tons slides telling possible instead actually it.
,"essential topics, instructor's delivery content inconsistent, glosses explanations time, ""umms arrrs"" lot, talks extremely fast times."
,making course quite hard follow.
,disclosure: english first language.
,new programming.
,new mooc courses.
,"really hoping complete data science specialization, found first couple courses cohesive."
,"course particular ok, lectures application (projects assignments) wide gap found mostly teaching myself..."
,built beginning programmers.
,lectures programming assignments nowhere close level.
,lot like teaching someone alphabet asking write short story lesson.
,"first things, first."
,i'll probably explore free courses/videos.
,swirl package contents better lectures videos.
,"video lectures introduced concepts without context, making difficult understand."
,video lectures also demonstrate anything.
,"swirl package much better ""showing one,"" ""doing one."""
,course requires already know program r taking course.
,"although lessons quizzes doable, assignments way hard even covered lectures."
,abandon course could assignments.
,meant complete beginner.
,"i've spoken dozen people taken course, programming skills, struggle."
,"i'm suggesting doable complete beginner, time commitment may prohibitive."
,informative definitely people far advanced background knowledge r. professor goes quickly course jumps new topics without much explanation guidance.
,good way get help ask questions get stuck.
,"inspite done courses coursera(like machine learning stanford, sas programming sas) edx (python, r), many things went head."
,decided pursue data science course further.
,lectures prepare quizzes/assignments.
,class beginners.
,would better used r lecturing instead talking whole lecture.
,got swirl tutorials lectures.
,assignment way hard without guidance - course mentioned earlier lectures meant go online ask.
,"even so, way beginners like us understand questions pinpoint to."
,"course absolutely beginner little knowledge r even interested data science specialization... made clear avoid waste time, efforts budget.. worth subscription"
,much relation course gives (explains videos swirl exercises) real exercices ask to.
,difficult follow people new programming area.
,think course setup beginner person never used r...very frustrated needing search internet help everything course supposed teaching me.
,impossible leap difficulty assignments (especially week 2) lecture material.
,poorly designed serious lack guidance.
,"however, quizzes help consolidate knowledge lectures."
,r beginners.. sure many people trying get r discouraged.
,much great things r without making complicated done here.
,"heavy math/programming terms necessarily familiar beginner level, making impossible follow course logic explanations."
,please revise course.
,like lecturer teaches.
,"theoretical, simple concepts makes rocket science."
,would better exmaple less theory.
,difficult follow new type programming.
,"best take course trying swirl, data camp, code school."
,"background software development, know thing two writing code."
,"i'm halfway course, i'm really struck two things:"
,"course beginner friendly, really hard follow assignments lectures programming r background."
,videos adequately prepare students programming assignments.
,instructor provide support regarding homework.
,"r good know tool, many process automated now."
,quite easily xls spss cases.
,"detailed explanation, everything left assignments expected contents programming examples videos"
,"videos helpful, fast."
,lot time spent functions f. swirl helps lot.
,pedology used interest learner.
,seems instructor reading slides.
,lecture general.
,courser beginners.
, need this
,there's connection assignments given lecture taught.
,many contexts missing.
,would really helpful teacher gives examples graphs explains concepts.
,"presumes certain baseline level programming skills, technical beginner"
,hard absorb professor fast fluent speech...
,course needs coding part videos sufficient solving assignments.
,"taught kind abstract, due beyond taught"
,focused condition function find course helpful.
,get impression would better learning r own.
,"definitely beginners, also well organized."
,disorganized course materials.
,gaps materials.
,really impressed courses far...
,"morely designed slideshows, effective."
,course difficult beginners.
,hard beginners opinion
,peng incomprehensible.
,need cover basics oop
,final assessment though
,looking
,difficult beginners
,"enrolled course familiar statistical analysis wanted become adept using r, course disappointing."
,"lecture material practice assignments swirl nice, leave totally unprepared complete quizzes assignments."
,massive leap difficulty practice assignments lectures quizzes programming assignments.
,"going back lectures, practice assignments, textbook provide minor assistance assignments - enough information complete assignment."
,"course resources inadequate, students must spend hours googling troubleshooting order finish assignments."
,"article posted course discussion board claims due creators wanting instill ""hacker mentality"" students, work find answers themselves."
,"agree students spoon-fed answers, course charges admission fee."
,"took course looking resources learn - wanted spend hours searching random corners internet answers r programming questions, could've done time charge."
,feel like took basic anatomy course first test required safely remove someone's appendix.
,"short, take class."
,"planning learn r, go buy book."
,course complete scam.
,least pay money.
,reasons; 1.)
,advertise need couple hours study per week.
,"that's lie, study much unless know little r programming."
,quiz questions totally unrelated lessons.
,teach basic stuff expect accomplish intermediate quizzes.
,instructor idea teach.
,may trying prove something.
,really understand motives.
,really want teach that's simple.
,"couple extra videos teach whatever asking quizzes, tell us read certain material."
,means either know teach specialization complete scam.
,4.)
,really understand coursera way?
,kind business model this.
,planning enroll many specializations going it.
,think much loosing.
,quality assurance.
,one guy comes say teaches believe them?
,advice you: pay anything specialization.
,course read bad reviews first (which mistake).
,materials course poorly thought out.
,"(content lectures match quizzes assignments, example."
,"obviously intentional, course calls hacking skills emphasized."
,mean googling things figuring stuff own.
,"however, course gets barely step buying book amazon it."
,"yes, course nearly free, time valuable.)"
,"example, unit missing values explains na nan, mention complete.cases, one need assignment."
,"like 5 minute video, cover well?"
,"worse that, assignments quizzes deliberately designed trip up."
,think fulfilled assignment get quiz realize cannot answer question using code wrote required add extra bells whistles.
,"process demoralizing obviously intended make learner feel though fault struggling, fact time learner informed educational materials provided intentionally insufficient."
,underlying weed-them-out educational philosophy really place 21st century.
,"took first week, quitted."
,took first-week course twice.
,first time took it--i thought problem--because code many years can't follow it.
,"took second time realized me, course itself."
,poorly structured!!!!!
,"lot concepts first course, like objects, vector, list, sequence, attribute, class, integer, etc."
,might ask listed concepts structured.
,instructor taught once!
,wanted ask know structure course!
,"also know beginning course, give overview first, structure notions dive details."
,introduce notion object first.
,"introduce attributes objects, among class one attributes."
,introduces basic object vector.
,"introduce different formats vectors, create them."
,coursera experience disturbed courses specialization much.
,feel shame instructors.
,really high hopes course.
,"programmer, though college learned c, c++, used matlab fair amount."
,wanted learn r free software versus paying licencing fee use spss done past.
,already completed first week course first week course.
,went slides really feel like learned actual programming expect answer questions program seemed bit left field.
,comparison felt like hour worth slides talking different trees differentiate asked drive tank.
,took time go two swirl assignments hoped going fill many gaps left slides.
,"definitely helpful slide show, still felt like would teach add ask multiply."
,"general recommendation would take course unless fairly solid understand programming, otherwise wasted $50."
,"contents, thrown videocast dumpout, nothing assignments."
,remember beginners' class.
,eg.
,"week2, elements functions necessary carry assignment simply taught, despite excellent swirl entire course ( case missed something) irretrievably stuck."
,many judge forums.
,point teaching beginner's courses beginners applying graduate school thinking discourages?
,excuse poor unfocussed teaching.
,"suggest wary j.hopkins school course moving forward, deliver course meets expectations: real life, student stuck, help out, least highlight course material: course can't done here, course material related assignment."
,pointed numerous times forum.
,"shameful teaching marc messier, phd."
,course teachers
,poorly constructed.
,major jumps difficulty material completely unnecessary.
,material could easily broken manageable comprehensible chunks.
,repetition exercise function engrain material.
,"course suffers grossly ""curse knowledge""."
,"structured way (a) material broken smaller bits, ideally beta tested true rank novices (b) materials specific functions presented repetition, similar khan academy structures math section, course would much better."
,"would also assume, given b, would higher retention comprehension."
,expected time requirements also wildly amiss.
,try beta testing true rank novices.
,"program suggests ""beginners""."
,find doubtful true beginner would fare well course.
,"university course place advance knowledge ""limited reasonable"" amount time spent course."
,"role instructors ""invest"" time provide concepts information students course ""learn"" faster research (the planet) find knowledge."
,"information provided instructors therefore must ""accurate complete""."
,"course many ""incomplete"" pieces information, requires insurmountable amounts time ""find"" concepts required apply knowledge, hence becomes gigantic ""time waster""."
,unfortunate!
,"tool concept data science necessary, course organized way ""full time students"" one obligation, study."
,course coursera.
,"concepts language explained, assignments - simple conceptually - cannot done taught week, materials poorly structured."
,"class introduced operators, properties, etc mentioned right away.)"
,"point taking class get guide move forward fast, save time spent reading forums, walking though books hundreds pages."
,"class save time all, causes lot frustration."
,": cast character data frame (used 1st assignment) done as.numeric(as.character(char)), instead as.numeric(str) seems natural me."
,must reason need cast(?)
,"char character casting numeric, instructor thought worth mention.)"
,take it.
,take course unless programming background.
,week 2 programming assignment way advanced students without programming knowledge.
,"assignment deals functions, code complicated."

,great learning steps
,
,worth every minute
,mi favorita
,"coverage good clear linkage concepts included beginning rest contents flow - throughout course, also entire specialization."
,would really help instructor would speak little slowly (a bunch words get garbled) slides lesser content (have slides redesign).
,"way, instructor might feel forced talk much per slide listening might little easy ear."
,"however, take anything away content organized - good takes flow rather well."
,great course main problem little help available.
,programming assignment able understand meaning able find start (what first step?)
,pace little fast.
,learned lot cloud computing.

,support forums many complaints assignment.
,would rate 5 stars experience programming assignment something even approaching decent.
,content pretty good.
,"content quizzes good, last quizzes extremely unnecessarily long."
,programming assignment really unpleasant enough walk away entire certification.
,starter template assignment really poorly written found difficult get started.
,good luck finding useful support discussion forums.
,course content covers lot diverse topics would prefer explanation comprehensive depth beginner understand big picture well details vividly.the assignment pretty good creates good learning curve c++(especially pointers) understanding one important concepts cloud computing.
,"issue programming assignment, could descriptive."
,"also, could've given us option choosing programming language."
,course contents composed superficial concepts cloud computing.
,code framework programing assignment written c++ probably worst kind code i've ever seen.
,"course interesting, however, advanced templated c++ code far heavy most."
,i've dropped class i'm even going attempt assignments viewing first one.
,like material lectures huge problem ta platform like piazza ask questions.
,think would nice ta advisor answer questions
,would helpful include examples quiz questions.
,adding tutorial materials (or links) setting environment would also greatly appreciated.
,cloud computing distributed systems.
,feels like bait switch.
,looking learn (because i've already done that!)

,expecting higher quality though.
,time study future
,interview good
,content legacy.
,"course totally beginner, even pass prerequisite 100% score easily."

,"opinion, course little harder algorithm course."
,"(btw, find another alternative yet, maybe people could suggest.)"
,"lots reviewers mentioned, c++ gossip assignment really mess non-c++-expert, even experienced non-c++ programmer."
,hope could pass course gain lots insights places future.
,"actually course contains decent material, long pay homework programming assignment."
,"homework final test ask detail concret implementation, instead concept idea."
,"comes vector timestamp/unicast/multicast, cases presented tests homeworks presented unnecessarily complicated way."
,"also starting code programming assignment written bad way, codeing style design decision, takes time get started it."
,basically like course content.
,recommend pay homework/programming assignment.
,course beginners winform lovers.
,real re-branding yourself.
,would say path reborn real open source world living in.

,honest could finish course.
,lecture speaks fast never time think listening get information settled.
,give second week!
,that's pity!
,extremely boring lots academic stuffs.
,totally disappointed.

,starts history ends beating code write php!
,"simple course, expected spend time professional course unfortunately didn't."
,challenges like real world satisfied course
,"start course really fun interesting, becomes boring complicated, especially week 6,7 8. assignments weeks 6 7 useful meaningless."
,php taught used car salesman.
,"intermediate course, compare alongside something like ""beginning programming c"" duke university, really reflects poorly university michigan, whose reputation precursor signed first place."
,"besides lack meaningful exercises, instructor comes self-obsessed narcissist would rather post ""extra"" content students introducing pictures himself, promoting courses, rather actually teach material."
,"still day understand php resources often lacking, yet course case-in-point example how, even one eager learn modern standards much-maligned technology, commonly presented sub-standard, highly generalized material embraces language afterthought behind shiny vehicle ""building website."""
,good introduction php.
,"went clue going beyond screen i'm able run website, scripts, private server."
,"thing i'd say exercises, provided material almost complete enough things left figure (which helps lot learn)."
,think course worst i've taken site.
,"well organized, professor unclear tends fill lectures information useful class (a lot history, would fine concrete how-to information)."
,"also, feels clunky date."
,testing/rating good.
,assignments poorly written.
,"also, specialization called ""web applications everybody"" multiple times class, instructor says something like: ""i assume learned python another coding language starting class."""
,"would hardly call ""for everyone."""
,think misleading.
,would recommend class.

,still cannot get passed!
,would taking course part specialization........ improvements need made!
,"instructor explain concepts, superficially goes subjects."
,lectures lack coherence subjects.
,know relation topics.
,introduces basic stuff worth knowing anyway.
,course makes give data science moocs.
,"seriously, content poorly presented keeps speaking , telling 2-3 lines function on."
,highly recommend stay away pathetic specialization.
,discouraging course specialization.
,instructions programming assignments misleading poorly worded.
,issue every module specialization text mining spectacularily bad.
,need spend hours browsing discussion group figure expected.
,"mentors great job explaining forum, feedback loop - instructions never corrected."
,"sometimes see forum post misleading simply wrong instruction, dated 6 months ago, instruction still corrected."
,like no-one cares.
,"feel like 70% time spent course learning text mining, dealing ambiguous instructions autograder issues."
,lectures good perfect explanation.
,lectures liked assignment questions.
,get know basic foundation text mining.
,one worst courses ever attended.
,subject treated surface.
,exercises sometimes covered lectures.
,auto-grader badly configured.
,annoying frustrating exercises.
,sometimes untold oderering results expected.
,sometimes untold normalization done.
,professor wooden.
,quizzes ridiculously easy.
,programming assignments nearly impossible.
,beware hidden workings auto-grader.
,"lucky, one students prompt tas action forums."
,"is, far, worst course specialization."
,professor needs prepare students better exams assigments.
,lectures.
,autograder disadvantage sometimes take many hours figure out.
,"also, course let compared previous specialization."
,wish examples.
,"outdated supported, literally need spend hours try figure emulate versions used autograder even file structure files used default accurate get file read errors predefined functions virtual environment need fix them!!!"
,virtual machine env provided super slow need use own.
,bad user experience horrible use time!
,especially assignments unbelievable waste time.
,"instead focusing important concepts applications, one spend hours one ""pleasing autograder"" renaming columns reading discussion pages correct interpretation ambiguously formulated questions."
,sad!
,"would good everyone removed (otherwise great) series ""applied data science python""."
,obsolete course
,"order magnitude times better previous course, 'applied machine learning,' kevyn collins-thompson."
,professor v. g. vinod vydiswaran started lectures purpose alluring example.
,"spent good amount time building intuition behind algorithms techniques involved, saved coding challenging satisfying homework assignments--all qualities previous course have."
,"finally, professor v. g. vinod vydiswaran simply energetic teaching."
,change playrate > 1.2x.
,genuinely enjoyed teaching style.
,course restored faith 'applied data science python' specialization university michigan confident ability solve text classification problems python.

,flowed felt could execute learned without much head scratching due 'missing leaps info'.
,exactly says label.
,makes really think text.
,finished course yet.
,syllabus reading materials look really nice intro nlp course.

,great content!!
,productive session!
,nicely taught concepts
,clear nice explanations.
,nice course .... loved
,wonderfol course
,course material good would give 5-star it.
,reason took 1 star back instructor seems well prepared course.
,"first, used 'so' frequently lecturing."
,"saying totally use filler words (like 'hmm' 'um', 'so' one them), saying using many fillers could cause distraction confusion."
,"'so' one transition words, implies logical connection 2 sentences."
,using 'so' lot actually distracting following course material identify 'so' filler could ignore 'so' consequence indicator could pay attention following sentence.
,"second, sometimes seemed get lost slides."
,"example, week 3 video ""learning text classifiers python"" slide 13:36, slide easy understand showing codes saying ""nltk.classify something called sklearnclassifier could let use models scikit-learn naive_bayes svm 2 examples"", way explaining slide quite confusing."
,"kind ""mistakes"" cost extra time look scripts make sure misunderstand anything."
,"overall well done course, autograder week 2 needs lot work."
,"buggy, broken gave uninformative answers."
,awesome course..it good start nlp.
,comprehensively covers topics.
,autograder programming assignment needs
,good material people wants start nlp.
,thanks lot material
,frequent well thought exercises helpful
,overall goods intro text analysis
,basic nice course
,grading system supremely messed least vague idea talking completed dozen coursera courses.
,"also, methods used courses teaches bad coding approach relying global variables."
,example module 2: def example_two(): return len(set(nltk.word_tokenize(moby_raw))) # alternatively len(set(text1)) example_two() would pass moby_raw text1 arguments function?
,"said, course could easily one best intro nltk courses minus frustration poor design."
,"course gives good broad understanding nlp task would work theory, course unstructured."
,"example, given task sentiment analysis, broadly tell conceptual theory behind dont know exactly professor talked many tools repetitive use clearly demarcated tool used what?"
,course materials amazing much support assignments.
,quizzes assignments except last one.
,seems something wrong auto-grader assignment clear.
,complains issue forum one staff answered questions.
,course would significantly improved hands-on demos lectures.
,lectures high-level terribly useful trying lab exercises.
,"course materials interesting, also lot issues autograder."
,hopefully fixed next sessions.
,"helpful example projects, autograders work really difficult pass assignments finicky system"
,course pitched introductory level.
,would like practical tutorials.
,think course superficial could better explored.
,"good start, though."
,"good contents, clearly explained."
,bad autograder
,major qualms course.
,"far specialization, course certainly worst."
,"*the autograder terrible, serious, known issues 8+ months time review."
,"*the course content incorrect, teaching learners incorrect way calculate roc_auc_score."
,"*the course blows certain topics, like part-of-speech tagging & parsing sentence structure, leaving learners like without good overview."
,even good set links learn more.
,"run commands understand might important, idea use practice."
,"*unlike courses specialization, one good links interesting academic papers real world applications."
,"*unlike courses, every week include weekly juptyer notebook.here's simple solution - give uwe, excellent active mentor, permissions fix broken course."
,"plus side: instructor ok, topic interesting, course really feels terrible relative excellent courses specialization."
,still hardily recommend specialization...
,"working entire specialization, applied data science python."
,"first two courses specialization lot attention detail, assignments well laid challenging, addition resources linked instructor really helpful."
,"moreover, lectures engaging segmented."
,course less informative courses i've taken specialization.
,would much better purchasing o'reilly text analysis python book reading detail prior taking course in-between lectures.
,module applied data science python incredibly poor comparison modules.
,"assignments sometimes related course material, may 1 practical/lab every week course - enough help assignment."
,"videos accompanying notebooks actually apply concepts, meaning finished module little skill improvement."
,"overall, comparison modules, severely let course, much theory enough practical work."
,course packed information topics four weeks feels sometimes rushed.
,"especially forth week (topic modelling, information extraction, semantic similarity generative models one week) feels disconnected rest ."
,"exercises help much, several mistakes ambiguity."
,"nevertheless, theme really interesting."
,possibly errors corrected next runs.
,plus using python nltk.
,disappointed lectures course.
,"impression extremely complex concepts mentioned passsing poorly explained, large amount time spent trivial examples."
,"programming assignments interesting appropriately challenging (compared courses specialization), leave without confidence could accomplish text mining task python independently."
,"kind disappointed course especially lecturer talking much showing practical examples, example 'topic modelling'."
,slides introduction topic modelling showing lines code without examples notebook helping lot.
,course repeat lot seen module 3 specialization.
,enough coding examples first assignment well design.
,lectures prepare enough tackle assignments.
,"however, getting assignments right extremely annoying."
,sometimes idea right.
,every upload need change type upload.
,good course great content lecturer however assignments buggy run jupyter notebooks.
,frustrating deal paid course.
,please fix!
,provide enough sample codes real-life text mining applications.
,videos high level enough understand context material.
,content course quite good.
,level teaching way less level assignments.
,ist assignment difficult perform..
,"course takes important nlp topics, instruction decent, assignments clunky waisted many hours time unproductively."
,paying mentors respond posts discussions?
,need pay monthly ignored struggle learn own.
,difficult understand hell lecturers speak eat half words speak.
,also transcript video shows incorrect words.
,repeat damn video gazillion times understand
,awesome first week.
,great second week.
,third week understand concept taught.
,hard understand professor follow along.
,terminology used advanced hard pay course research catch up.
,would like give course worse 1 star.
,course explanations poor.
,explanations drag make sense.
,"go outside sources make sense videos discussing, felt like defeats purpose."
,paying something use sources better explain.
,would never recommend course anyone.
,listening teachers explain subject poorly killing me.
,like learn examples provide makes confusing hard follow.
,instructor got worse worse!
,videos hard watch accents made even worse!
,feel robbed taking course.
,"asked refund within first week, felt since paying, would stick little longer."
,get better explanation take subject youtube videos subject.
,useless course.
,hated every week course dare continue full specialization program.
,"sad hear course gets recommended lot, missed mark completely."
,material quite really well-prepared lecture really understandable.
,highly recommend course want consolidate algorithm data structure knowledge
,best course clearing basics algorithms well learning blow mind thinking hard different prospectives get desired solutions programming assignments ...
,programming assignments insanely amazing.
,one worse learning experiences.
,"might good field probably are, know teach output close zero."
,every piece course bad.
,"presentation either blank reading slides zuckerberg face overly emotional recycling daniel kane, man stresing every following sentence, impossible follow."
,"content classics former ussr educational style: dry, high context, small explanation moments easy parts sometimes completely skipping complex parts."
,leaving huge parts material external sources complimentary book.
,quiz questions sometimes formulated entangled manner puzzle untangle them.
,"mention quiz format utter failure, like one input 6 digits corresponding answer option rank."
,"""best"" part programming assignments."
,"work thru lecture quiz, somehow get understanding solve types problems."
,bam 8 programming assignments 3 types discussed lectures.
,what's point lectures all?
,"mean, without lectures would 8 types problems know solve, big increase 5. took wonderful course prof. tim roughgarden."
,"everything: good presentation style, enough redundancy lecture material get better understanding complex topics, nice quiz question simple answer mechanics important, material got enough assignments."
,reasons decided lock one source information explore options.
,want good course algorithms waste time one.
,go directly prof. tims algorithms specialization offered princeton
,one taken algorithms 1 2 course profs.
,"sedgewick wayne, course disappointment waste time."
,"want learn theoretical practical computer science, specialization."
,i'm completely sold specialization one week.
,"instructors extremely helpful high level clarity videos, forums."
,language semi-agnosticism excellent!
,forums active friendly!
,hit ground learning right away specialization!
,course far motivated immensely delve software engineering education.
,"get bachelor's degree computer science, associate's."
,"though work industry, wanted programming competitions personal projects make lack experience ideas implementation algorithms data structures."
,"course jump-started journey beyond current abilities, believe you."
,"even remotely thinking would interested taking courses, do!"
,must confess bit hesitant start specialization.
,"3 weeks in, happy started specialization."
,course right pace instructors nicely divided videos shorter logical entities easy understand.
,love exercises.
,"exercises courses taken coursera provide lot code already done write small piece code complete assignments, one."
,"need write whole assignment own, right choosing appropriate data structure algorithm design."
,"sure starter code look solution, order check code design well."
,"must say, awesome course."
,great work guys putting together.
,"i'm still week 2, far i'm loving it."
,"far interesting engaging thought would be, hard thought would be."
,"requires programming experience (a months practice maybe advanced understanding programming language choice do) ""mathy"" way algorithms explained little scary good maths background (like me!)"
,let scare away.
,everything actually much simpler looks like real demand patience willingness find new ways solve problems.
,"every time assignment right, feel like ""leveled up"" problem solving skills little bit."
,looking forward rest specialization.
,blown away amount effort designers put this.
,extremely high quality.
,"thank much thoughtful problems solve, well thought lectures, many supplemental resources provided."
,could rate highly enough!
,i'll keep eye specializations produce
,"learned stress test two different logic, helped lot choosing best algorithm."
,course complete mess.
,1. week 2 presented fibonacci numbers solution said runtime complexity quadratic presented solution linear.
,2. practical task week 2 provide sufficient description done 3. language speakers mediocre
,"algorithmic toolbox consists series slides containing slimmed explanations introductory algorithmic concepts, followed programming assignments."
,"slides centrepiece course, presenters rarely stray bullet points pseudocode they're comprised of."
,"although, gain confidence knowledge, course require seek additional materials supplement learning."
,"perhaps unsurprising introductory course, presenters struggle faced setting expectations."
,"throughout course presenters often gloss fairly complex concepts, treating trivial knowledge."
,"applies mathematical definitions, proofs steps skipped, tree diagrams without context underlying theory, bullet points used place could detailed explanations."
,material left equally weighted.
,"rather providing explanations like: ""we need go detail this, x concept important want focus on."
,"reference chapter book detail."""
,presenters would read mathematical definitions verbatim slides move on.
,often unsure much would need know concepts.
,"terms communication ability, presenters hold many free/low-cost services i'm accustomed using, example: mit opencourseware, udacity, edx, khan academy, code school, treehouse, etc."
,"perhaps unsurprising, competing services often feature professional communicators rather professional researchers."
,marketplace quality online education definitely becoming competitive one.
,users expect nothing less presenters exceptional communication/teaching ability.
,videos presenters read verbatim slides motion hands explain concepts would better broken whiteboard.
,"rarely straying slides, times presenters go depth concept, get scribble corner slide, lacking clarity i've come expect approaching complex concepts master educators like youtuber patrickjmt khan academy."
,"couple weeks course, went straight slides, read mit's introduction algorithms, skipped course videos."
,"things considered, course served good curriculum guide focus introductory concepts, regardless sought out."
,material great much information first hole specialization but!
,explanation weak match big data pseudocode distracting hard read always get lost know array code variable want pseudocode normal english code saying understandable signs :\ really sad get benefits amount knowledge
,def useful skills starting interview jobs.
,hard course teach begin with.
,"found lectures really boring, long, hard understand really motivated well."
,"think homework problem good, time consuming."
,"need use various methods find edges cases though might good skill well, much get done one week somewhat frustrating stuck one test case."
,think could excellent course modification slides adding motivations making shorter homework problems focuses main part material oppose things we've already covered previous week.
,"moment, think i'll continue specialization way designed."
,auto-grader py codes big let me.
,auto-grader takes long produce result (more 1 hour) many times case.
,one organizing team spent time resolving issue.
,py code big let me.
,way i/o done pretty lame.
,"print statement displayed states ""pls give input"" etc... output need ctrl + z see answer."
,imho bad coding i/o.
,organizers need understand working professionals pressed time automation help rather frustrate lead loss time.
,0 star option would definitely give so.
,"many courses completed platforms like cousera, udemy, edx etc."
,one worst all.
,anything wasted time.
,regret enrolling course.
,even watching videos 2-3 times often watch videos youtube.
,way explaining teachers fascinatig.
,nutshell reading comment please waste time course.
,rather watch youtube videos learn platform.
,go youtube search data structure algorithms videos.
,instructors language barrier makes super difficult go course.
,help stuck either.
,keep making everything complicated keep using fancy tough math words.
,interested academic side computer science take course otherwise waste time.
,tried specialization canceled 7-days free explanation poor teacher.
,seeing big-o notation possible see poor explanation time need access content source khanacademy.
,acceptable.
,unsatisfied.

,course awesome hold immense value anyone new field computer science wants add repertoire amazing world algorithms.
,algorithms basic tool computer scientist still constant demand development.
,course develops knowledge important topic starting basic slowly steadily building towards apex.
,"said, course sometimes becomes bit heavy multiple reviews video needed completely understand topic."
,algorithms topic made spoon feeding course treats way.
,"professors awesome, one idiosyncrasies fun interesting time."
,level go make topic clear appreciable.
,"note would really like mention prof. alexander kulikov brilliant way teaching making topic playground real life scenarios ""toy examples""."
,"overall, course blown away."
,thanks made course end thanks coursera.
,like course structure material.
,"starts easy enough get interested throws challenges early stage, it."
,"like video session itself, instructors talk fast dwell much topic, assuming understood everything."
,"way composite that, offer ""resource"" links help understand."
,"""hard"" accent, really difficult follow even native speaker, yet alone whose english second language."
,exercise assignments spot forced relay sources grasp everything.
,"doubt anyone taking course reached ""outer"" help least once."
,overall like course.
,beginning course light easy follow.
,"concepts got in-depth, weeks (namely 4 5) felt rushed somewhat incomplete."
,"regardless, never exposed type material, price, would recommend course anyone looking get feet wet algorithms."
,"course gives good overview algorithms types problems, cannot used standalone source algorith,s learning."
,use good textbook well.
,"programming challenges really interesting (and challenging), sometimes took couple evenings complete five week assignments."
,"course well structured homework interesting challenging, minus 1 star teachers really heavy accents bad english pronunciation, mute sound watch videos subtitles."
,"accent teachers would little bit annoying, also fact topics (incomes, outcomes programs) unclear naive student."
,"rest, great way introduce programming."
,content full helpful.
,instructors used marker explaining walk codes instead putting slide talking background.
,"course material good indeed, instructors somewhat difficult understand strong accents."
,subtitles largely inaccurate.
,practice question helps solidifying understanding.
,"1 star less, could improved giving dry run example algorithm implementation."
,"i'd like failed tests, submitted programs, shown, order better idea wrong."
,found course really helpful approaches solving algorithmic problems test inputs unknown.
,"great ""toolbox"" programmer."
,full course available assignments non payers.
,certificate provided paid.
,"content good, lecturers terrible."
,better read slides read book like.
,watching videos wast time.
,awesome journey!
,"however, think assignments extensive."
,assignments good standard!
,i'd say tough challenging best part course.
,"hi, please cover examples o(log n ) o(n log n)."
,o(n) o(n2) easy understand.
,helps one apply mind solve.
,wish exercises asymptotic analysis.
,"nice course good practice problems awesome explanation language specific, may good bad"
,"really think good course, hard understand beginner."
,"explanation could clear, especially polynomial multiplication."
,"nice algorithms ""free"" programming language."
,"good course, come know algorithms"
,good course ample practice questions.
,lots mathematics challenging
,"well designed course ,very helpful."
,dynamic programming need stronger
,nice stress testing learned
,assignments like acm handbook.
,good organized course
,good starter student
,"course first part specialization, beta tester course practically nothing all."
,"instructors filled bit, revealed could call ""adequate""."
,"would encouraged seen course's full content undertake specialization, although i'm sure dedicated student find challenging thorough."
,assessment better courses course sequences offer study algorithms algorithmic complexity cover material course.
,"done evaluation later courses specialization, might better one."
,"so, exactly thumbs-down me, imo, better."
,"explanation video complex, literlly help forum faculty."
,many threads answered 4 - 6 months.
,even reply time stress test.
,"strongly feel course targets excellent programming skills, begainner moderate level skills, one struggle letterally get help whats ever."
,unable use coding platform efficiently.
,"get output,enter inputs even thugh assignment fully correct,i failed it,just output appropriate, looking video submission several times, things clear submission probably output."
,"content good, could probably make fun learn instead run theorem pseudo code."
,"tone narrative always like listening someone emotion, sometimes makes sleepy."
,occasionally play videos fall asleep faster.
,"like fact get solve many problems every week lectures, instructors explain things vocally also fast paced."
,really difficult follow compared lectures instructors write white board explaining.
,"course old infomation super confusing, provide starter code answers alreaady it."
,clearly updated dont want waste time limited time upskill skills full time work.
,"迮??? 邾郇郋迠迮??赲郋 郇迮迡郋???郋赲 郕訄郕 赲 ??訇?邽??訄?, ?訄郕 邽 赲 ?訄邾邽? ?郅訄邿迡訄?."

,could find whats wrong programming assignments.
,atleast able see test case failing.
,assignments managed poorly.
,"possible muddle course retain it, understanding higher math big notation pretty essential."
,"lectures poorly explained, need review 2-3 times understand."
,"that, good course beginners."
,"even though course covers lot fundamentals introduction algorithm, course designed good expected."
,"starters, weekly problem designs good."
,problem statements ambiguous clear unless read one time take closer look examples.
,"often, input format/arguments designed take redundant info."
,"problem even one possible correct outputs, confusing learning purpose."
,"terms lecture videos, good classic algorithm problems demonstrated video, however linkage express problem mathematical languages poorly explained."
,"example, lecture edit distance, realization matrix well explained all."
,"personally appreciate lot thorough proving steps introduced lectures, however personally think proofs often well explained audience (i also understand difficult explain proving steps)."
,"considering large variety audience, would recommend instructors separate comprehensive in-depth knowledge optional videos, way audiences could decide want spend time optional videos based needs, meanwhile instructors could spend little bit time explain difficult concepts better."
,"overall, know talking analyzing algorithms kinda boring challenging, wish course videos could stated interesting intriguing way."
,"course starts promising, gets worse week week, culminating barely understandable week dynamic programming."
,"that? gave decided write review instead, one assignment missing complete course."
,"teachers aren? native english speakers, fine, english hard understand."
,found watch portions videos order understand said.
,"tried reading transcripts instead, they?e even worse!"
,"seems automatically generated videos, thus suffering poor pronunciation."
,"teachers use mathematical sophistication feels unnecessary, fair, mention faq part necessary background."
,"however, even though it? online course, barely use teaching method besides raw slides, dry mathematical proofs someone speaking content."
,resources offered help learning open source visualizations.
,expected much more.
,"good aspect course assignment checkers, allow write solutions multiple languages."
,deeply regret money time spent course.
,javascript pain course.
,"example files using ""readline"" module reading input."
,suitable large data sets.
,starting week 4 possible use readline.
,reading bytes input stream helps.
,"next, main, issue grader reliable js code."
,code sometimes passes successfully next time fails.
,"sorting searching tasks cannot passed even using standard array,sort((a, b) => a-b) array.indexof()."
,i've spent hours finding issue code trying starndard js api search sort found cannot pass even using standard js api.
,shame course claims support js actually tasks possible pass using js.
,material ok. lectors good.
,"update: proceed wk 5, know complaint dynamic programming, reduced 2 stars."
,"lectures totally useless assignment, course really good week 4 deteriorates quick."
,"matter many times re-watch lecture, can't understand much."
,ended using wikipedia quiz instead :p can't use much course forum since many posts keep crashing chrome.
,"course gets 3 stars first 3 weeks alone, otherwise gonna 0-2 stars."
,started course gain knowledge algorithms disappointed.
,course lots assignments kind upgrade skills.
,disappointed way explanation.
,explanations like reading scripts.
,"also, give problem statement properly."
,"assignments, would find title problem actual problem statement."
,"instructors knowledgeable think explanations right mark, least me."
,two stars go instructor week 1. left course week 3 tolerate accents instructors.
,got frustrated starting week 2 reread subtitles understand material.
,"please let someone speak english fluently teach course, please."
,"course goes kinds fast, first course specialization quickly jumps greedy algorithm, really?"
,"general algorithm course, usually taught late."
,"course material good, assistance zero."
,"paying course, expect assistance order succeed."
,"talking feedback questions, grading system showing test case data case code fails."
,"that's happened there's test data, know code fails, therefore stuck learning happen."
,paid learning unacceptable.
,videos explanations poor.
,"time instructors reading script, everything feels fake."
,"reading script forced ""hand-wave"" explain concepts covered completely."
,"thing liked course problem sets, interesting do."
,"buy rest specialization, feels like cash cow ucsd."
,"lectures well done; however, course deprecated."
,active mentors directions exercises reconcile.
,"lastly, pycharm package prone bugs."
,"time claimed required course wildly off.. takes least 3 times 4 hours, allotted weekly assignments."
,"way, makes course expensive."
,language lecturer soo noisy can't understand words.
,listening first lecture i'm unenrolling course.
,feedback assignment good enough.
,"example, points segment, correct answer output reference."
,teachers faculties good explanation.
,moreover boring faces like interested teach us.
,content beginner friendly.
,quickly transitions pace intermediate level.
,found week 3 5 difficult.
,"programming technique - like dp, greedy could better."
,go website better understand concepts.
,"poorly explanied half course like dynamic programming, pavel parts exluding change problem"
,course clearly explained.
,difficulty following along course materials.
,"algorithm clear, homework submission system friendly all!"
,support course ended exercises longer compatible new versions java.
,"solving opengl issue installing jre 1.8, starter program still working should."
,think content course far objectives covered lectures video readings.
,"however, practice course programming needs updated still uses applets deprecated technology 2015-2017. think going programming assignments students provided form least uses current technologies, especially advertised ""real world""."
,"course also not, minimum, updated ""how to's"" run programming assignments using old technologies, explain java 8 prior needed (not current java 13 newer)."
,pretty terrible course.
,two observations far: 1.)
,libraries course requires use incredibly outdated broken.
,getting basic examples run sometimes impossible.
,i'm literally talking basic examples copied pasted straight class.
,moderators interact help comes finding work-arounds broken code libraries provided.
,"many people posted regards problems, yet one ever gets response."
,third course 4 course specialization oop.
,"week 11 specialization, far little mentioned oop concepts."
,"using oop concepts, without explanation."
,"every while, key word thrown in, never explained."
,whole course literally professor telling code copy paste program.
,"complete, run program works like told would (well duh, tell exactly write)."
,i'm going finish i've payed couple hundred dollars point want certificate.
,"however, posting everywhere let people know waste money."
,course removed coursera library uses project outdated
,"compared duke university classes, think low quality course."
,managed get assignments done short time.
,like fact classes heavily dependent starting eclipse.
,would preferred much class would showed set everything independent ide's.
,would preferred write programs debug editor choice.
,"also, course unnecessarily spread actual amount teaches."
,think entire course summarized two weeks materials.
,would say week4-5-6 important understanding oop.
,"videos good, sections pointless."
,really care videos talk someone difficulty particular topic.
,like videos walks examples/scenarios.
,aided understanding.
,think assignments well designed.
,"follow them, think good duke courses."
,(which course 1 2 oop java specialization.
,course course 3).
,learn oop concepts.
,think course good job teaching ooprogramming think designing projects using objects.
,enroll course intend become programmer need fundamental knowledge object oriented programming.
,study subject apply new things real curious project.
,course really awesome would recommend anyone interested software engineering using java programming language.
,little history background help understand excitement course.
,newly graduated field electrical engineering.
,"far, wrote code mainly c++ really participated challenging programming assignments."
,looking job (unluckily far ) quickly realize java programming really big job market.
,"reasons, got book java programming called ""starting java"", may due lack discipline really able move deeply book."
,"however since enrolled course, influenced tremendously design class.i got much positive vibe professor make class really exciting."
,level details use lecture videos make class really easy follow.
,"addition, class assignment plainly cool, practical, challenging."
,really feel like learning expert field.
,fact raised confidence gaining skills combined specialization magnify qualification job market.
,excellent course taking step forwards java programming.
,instructors great love concept challenge videos help clarify new concepts.
,programming assignments good although sometimes felt like challenging enough.
,course material long course could easily completed 2-3 weeks even less.
,"despite introductory course java, able follow along smoothly without prior java experience."
,however previous programming experience required.
,
,probably least favorite series far.
,"mostly much code already prewritten, makes difficult learn anything."
,"moreover, explanations complex topics like sorting searching algorithms, especially use java's comparable class severely lacking."
,idea supposed week 5 week 6 suffered consequence.
,"also, mouseclicked event handling needs better explanations."
,"core content decent, course badly needs update."
,"java course relying heavily applets outdated ui framework exercises assignments (applets actually removed totally java 11+, processing library relies native library that's available latest mac os) definitely on."
,would also good update course up-to-date java 8+ coding techniques.
,best java course seen years.
,best team instructors coursera courses.
,hope later specializations instructors.
,"delaying certificate finishing due java specialization, felt may need introductory course advised great instructor christine great instructor/course great university great rest san diego university courses."
,"well respected universities addition duke, michigan virginia compared short courses reputable universities"
,kudos professor!
,wish lucky enough tutelage great professor!
,"loved lucidly, made us understand java."
,special mention christine.
,coursera community.
,bless guys.
,idea much helping students like me.
,looking forward towards tutorials.
,ps: expect j2ee tutorials professors?
,"also, course algorithms professors?"
,"thanks, arya"
,"liked way professors insisted understanding mechanics behind concepts learned, using memory models asking pen paper drawing them."
,find pdfs course notes containing concepts discussed written form think i'll relisten videos write notes myself.
,"managed understand quite object oriented concepts blurry before, thank that."
,"now, practice time, avoid forgetting !"
,learnt bit java beforehand object oriented concept.
,would definitely attend courses uc san diego well pay course afford it!
,"deprecated java api used those, probably better choose different course."
,course reminds software engineering dry boring.
,took first two courses duke university little spoonfeed code.
,gave helper code majority classes written scratch programmer.
,satisfaction that.
,really get write code speak understand debug it.
,"coming ucsd methodolgy, fill blanks many hints feel like creativity stifled."
,half work goes setting eclipse map library referencing underlying source (protip: use google map source).
,think conflated complex projects enjoyable learning material.
,"ucsd profs reading this, focus much making large project multiple moving parts, focus first fact students actually get basics programming assignments."
,"lectures super easy understand project really builds intuition tie lecture material (this real world software engineering seems like...write little code, read people's code)."
,"tl;dr - coming duke's courses downgrade frankly, tedious."
,duke stuck four courses ucsd probably look makes programming fun (writing it; reading it).
,complex challenging.
,course uses old obsolete java technology: java applets.
,need update course teach unfoldingmaps javafx.
,really outdated
,"beginning course thought i'll get good experience usual coursera, wrong ... lot things >> introduced next course confusing data types & working things know it."
,"said that, anyone basics programming could pass course 6 months couldn't."
,please sure prerequisites next time.
,seems downloadable code ?
,can't find it.
,installing unfolding maps seems necessary ?
,elaboration video's.
,"opinion course totally balance explaining things like ""this""-keyword time expecting students install things like unfolding maps tweaking eclips."
,signed course hoping good introduction oo programming java able verify even learned anything.
,"course access course material, fact cannot even manually check answers correct certainty makes less efficient simply learning myself."
,cannot follow single thing talking about.
,prior coding experience languages still idea instructors getting at.
,explain everything horribly jump huge complex things explanation.
,worst course ever taken life.
,date material leads lot errors trying assignments current technology.
,unfortunate.
,positive still watch videos theoretical aspects.

,course materials seem made 10 years ago(on java 6) seem way run anymore.
,"trying install outdated jdk 1.8 course forces use, spend 4 days, learnt nothing."
,course outdated.
,things learn supported latest version java.
,course outdated boring
,reallly old
,would give additional stars possible.
,prior programming experience required (i think already specify prerequisite).
,"said, done basic programming never used gui libraries before, best possible introduction using libraries."
,"must say word course structure, material professors."
,"all, yes three professors, one word: amazing!!"
,tone encouraging privilege learn them.
,"course structure, 5 stars."
,combination core concept challenges cleared muddled concepts head.
,analyzing understanding support code breeze (it took multiple attempts umpteen reviews videos get far course definitely knowledgeable competent started) course material really good.
,highly motivated complete course go next one provided dedicated team fantastic teachers.

,good starter class.
,good class nice structured.
,"though think might bit fast-paced beginners (with little programming experience), many details ignored make comfortable details researching little bit."
,"personal experience, learned c/c++ years ago programming extensively using python/matlab everyday."
,class useful help pick c++ language.
,"good me, learned lot, final project complicated me, even pdf, clear least level already took oop college course."
,final stuck frustrating.
,despite jumping levels video video learn lot still 4 star.
,teaching bit fast.
,helped learn basic fundamentals c++ beginner.
,much impressed professor's way making things clear wanted beginner assignments explained professor instead reading pdf concepts would crystal clear.
,"wow, descriptive time needed quite effort searching various contents google."
,"overall, would hard novice get along little effort."
,"really, advanced mechanism checking submissions requiring peer reviews often slow unreliable praiseworthy."
,overall course good job balancing sufficient levels detail without losing big picture respect oop principles.
,examples good throughout.
,thought final image transform assignment interesting though particularly helpful indication mastery oop principles.
,believe course videos lectures pretty good.
,instructor explains pretty well makes learning course exciting.
,"however think course needs projects, challenging."
,possibly instructors course rely subsequent courses cover material.
,course helped solve problems strategically.
,instructor also helped make use patterns way optimize code see problem practical manner.
,truly helped enhance skills c++ data structures also fundamental problem solving skills.
,"great course, engaging videos, end project pretty good summation material covered."
,"would liked assignment week let practice coding bit more, i'm new c++ syntax bit weird, overall great class."
,lectures top-notch.
,feels like getting professional presentation c++ easy understand way.
,wish hands coding though.
,learn 10x practicing writing code vs. answering multiple choice.
,instructor made lot mistakes lecture.
,material neither clear easy understand.
,wish put explanation details.
,giving four stars instructor's response forum really quick.
,"fundamentals object-oriented programming, data types, memory allocations, classes, templates, inheritance main topics covered."
,thank giving opportunity learn.
,"say ""accelerated"" mean it."
,i'm glad took beginner c++ class taking otherwise would lost.
,"otherwise, lot fun."
,made really think final week 4 project challenging fun.
,like beginning course latter part course.
,could practice assignments projects.
,bad feel like towards end course rushes left lot things unexplained.
,think ta's active answering doubts one else help students really gets frustrating code know whats wrong.
,else everything else fine
,"good c++ crash course, especially someone object oriented programming experience."
,"experience another programming language prerequisite--though i'm sure make obvious, based reviews?"
,good quality like pace.
,"since experience programming, though c++, could go material quickly finish days."
,"still, feels like contents need bit polishing."
,entire code shown explaining easier learner correlate link understand displaying code bit bit form snippets leads confusion urge change
,"hello everyone,i finished object-oriented data structures c++ course illinois university, say fantastic experience."
,learned lot understanding topic precise.
,"yes found course useful also learned new things content wise honestly felt need increase also add advanced oop concepts like polymerphism, other."
,overall good..
,thankyou..!
,great experience course provides thorough understanding object oriented programming learned lot quizes well assignment good practice quick results.
,liked course much especially assignments.
,really enjoyed coding course.
,sometimes felt lost mentioning thing supposed knowing not.
,"great explanations professor, reason giving 4 stars due less support course staff."
,"although assignments well designed, instructions confusing."
,"could done better fashion, e.g., keeping difficulty constant, making things easy things hard makes student wonder skills."
,"really liked explanation ""how namespaces used c++""."
,one valuable take-ups course besides many interesting fundamentals taught
,"week 1,2 3 good revised week 4 , concept used lecture covered hard understand code written tower hanoi c++"
,learn lot important concepts quickly.
,assignments test fun really evaluate concepts.
,i'd love seen operator overloading.
,"think great one, need focus c++ programming assignments, test aspects further."
,overall enjoyed entire course.
,think bit easy.
,"expecting extensive knowledge practices c++ oop like inheritance, abstract class, virtual functions, advanced topics."
,final programming assignment actually normal coding assignment rather pure c++ object oriented programming.
,overall course enjoyable.
,"would bit better code-writing involved reinforce language, rather directly quizzing language esoterica."
,excellent support staff seems disappeared recently.
,moreover leap lecture material assignments little large.
,"course one best, gave 4 stars times assignment clear understandable due compiling probles too!"
,course nice project awful.
,i'm glad 'pro' code study felt relevant level content.
,far good !
,"parts build environment setup frustrating using different ide, got work eventually."
,skims topics.
,explanation concepts good merely overview.
,projects difficulty would benefit more.
,"overall good course, brainstorming practical exercises challenges."
,"medium hard kind course student ""know"" c++ language"
,course high level.
,like see detailed lectures gradded assignements get better handle pointers classes.
,nice course refersh c++ knowledge.
,"however, seem tutorial debugging."
,ended using gdb cloud9.
,finale project subbmition mechanichs best thing tried caused delay 3 4 days end project
,helps understand basics c++ would say u know atleast one language understand efficiently.
,enjoyed content.
,saved time reading books.
,found coding homework much easier class contents.
,general i'm sure c++ language want learn - hope value show future.
,eric really helpful.
,"excellent course practice remind skills, sometimes beginner level instead intermediate."
,"enjoyed course, years since taking anything c++ related."
,good start refreshing knowledge there.
,helpful getting know ds really helped build great patience solving bugs code
,"though terminologies driving crazy, like design programming assignments forum!"
,"instructor great teaching style, feel projects somewhat lacking rigor."
,computer-graded code nice change waiting weeks assignment graded courses.
,"unfortunately, final project covering little part course any."
,"i'm happy complete amazing course , opened new journey data structure"
,gave 4 5 tower hanoi lesson needs improvements
,language used instructor little complex fast.
,difficult catch up.
,challenges clarifications order proceed without needing much help
,material outdated fluid could been.
,"good course, although slightly sequence one two points"
,great course little explanation help subjects learning about.
,good course learners want learn data structure c++ .
,excellent lectures week 4 final program difficult beginner c++.
,great lecture entering c++.
,"however, instructor's q&a response quite late..."
,"challenges bit challenging, course fine"
,last module hurried.
,project related classes.
,quite quick brisk course.highly recommended brushing concepts.
,would better practice problems.
,"that, complaints."
,"lacks proper explanation topics, cover entire topic"
,"good introduction c++, introduces key programming concepts."
,"good course, excellent instructor, helpful quiz questions assignments"
,better student redressal system required.
,"amazing course,though little fast paced especially pointer part"

,thank coursera wonderful course
,topics/lectures bit difficult follow.
,good needs practical examples topic.
,solution 2 tower hanoi difficult follow
,kind difficult well-experienced c++ learner
,assignments challenging enough clear instructions.
,everything great.
,one best course data structures using cpp.
,pretty good could little hard beginners..
,course helpful learn c++ language.
,interesting course cover basic c++
,wonderful learning experience .
,enjoyed learning this..
,coure material helpful.
,pretty useful good intro c++
,well easy understand
,clearly easy understand
,kind useful basic
,need practice problems
,
,hope learn
,recomended course
,"content curriculum nice, great part it."
,explanations ok. homework pretty bad.
,"simple exercises, nothing learn them."
,final submission pretty bad.
,lot confusing explanations hues png class.
,spend 80% time understanding requirements.
,"coding part it, again, simple, useless, little learning."
,"content good, lazily presented."
,"proffesor constantly made many errors throughout whole course course expected happen class room setting, produce video supposed review posting really think happen."
,"also, find unacceptable bad subtitles are."
,"pretty awesome week 4. things started get difficult hard really upset programming assignment week 4, felt related topics covered, never talked images course!!"
,overall review fairly good.
,"expected intermediate objected-oriented course c++.. assignment week two include iostream.h library print, beginners."
,good course beginners minor experience programming.
,"beginner course, intermediate."
,would definitelly recommend course anyone would like start c++.
,"anyone experience, expect course much easy."
,good overview data structures.
,think would much previous experience subject.
,final project hard comparing taught lecture.
,enough teaching provided able final assigment
,occasionally confusing instructor.
,setup instructions work quite way explained.
,takes fiddling get things work.
,course overly reliant aws ide.
,video lecture automated transcript learning material provided.
,last project took lots time everything fine submission pattern.
,"week1-3 challenging week4, learned lot material provided."
,content course higher level.
,please introduced advanced knowledge.
,unclear times.
,testing rigorous.
,many errors code given
,difficulty evenly distributed last project unclear
,teach in-depth classes inheritance
,final project bad submition
,course content goood.
,"however, help/support moderators/instructors get stuck."
,dicussion forum old threads many queries unanswered.
,guide setting c++ environment garbage probably spent majority time trying create environment works.
,final project little far course content
,stuck week 2 challenge question.
,requests help go unanswered.
,frustrating course without learner support.
,discussion forums outdated.
,lectures fast insufficient examples given.
,recommend changing intermediate rating advanced rating.
,see many moderators listed forums however see little know moderator/instructor communication forums.
,aws working due able complete course
,want unroll
,really bad
,course practical!
,explains statistic concepts applied financial-related examples using python.
,"argue course cover enough python financial, statistics concepts."
,hey man !!!
,course baby intro course!!!
,"assumes either strong one/some aspects (either strong computer, stats, finance), want see aspects combined work something valuable."
,need learn everything car driving it?
,learn need get car moving man!!
,course spoon-feeding like elementary school teachers!!!
,"professor taught something, expected study own."
,"good stat, know programming reasonably well, know pick statistics understand materials."
,"able find tons courses introduces programming language/statistics, never tell useful programming language/statistics real life."
,course practical pick knowledge use immediately.
,highly appreciate professor xu's effort creating valuable course!
,
,"worst course, course makes interest learning start continue it."
,language wired boring.
,topics seem effective interesting.
,unenroll 2 weeks.
,prof.!
,felt course started pretty easily.
,covered basic things probability / statistics.
,felt start course okay fit since already knew talking about.
,changed pretty abruptly.
,assignments useful building solid understanding python using pandas.
,almost code you.
,"sometimes ""look code see does""."
,there's much hands learning important solid retention.
,"mind, really understand target audience supposed exactly."
,seems like know python statistics taking course.
,probably intermediate level.
,think could fixed specialization instead single course.
,think issue lies.
,"things expanded multiple courses, concept course could worked better."
,ended abandoning working course week 3 shifted two specializations python one statistics.
,"(i already know bit probability statistics, clearly enough course.)"
,zero walkthroughs.
,idea do.
,course incomprehensible
,appreciate minor things phyton ommitted order explain important things rapidly.
,"never coded (like me) want follow course seriosuly, understanding every line code, additional research online, read example exact synthax certain method function used."
,"truly wish follow course, go depth see examples."
,"sometimes accent teacher wrong (english) subtitles make harder understand certain part, one funny example ""shot"" stock instead shorting it."
,"instances actually made tougher understand certain parts example verb-noun agreement easy understand, english first language take said grain salt well!"
,"again, really hope decide part 2 !"
,would enroll immediately
,good course learn basics python analyze financial stock market data.
,"however, prior knowledge statistics financial data (variance, histograms, regressions, value risk, hypothesis testing, ...), course might fast understand background, cannot explain things properly 2-3 hours video."
,guess people want analyze stock data python knowledge.
,"article provides broad application python, finance statistics."
,"actually, i'm looking classes like these."
,found yet.
,atlast takes consolation.
,needed.
,course cannot designed simply courses.
,really needs done once.
,"thank person devised course instructor, mr.xuhu wan, careful attention detail delivering information."
,course provides great insight python used statistical analysis.
,become extremely helpful examining finance-related data.
,professor wan really understand explanations help ease difficulties concepts.
,explanations clear application via jupiter notebooks excellent.
,"accent sometimes bit difficult follow ok, instructor overall excellent job."
,"clear explanation statistics python, well-prepared exercise notebook basic bags python recommended use data processing."
,great course makes basics clear.
,top course taught excellent tutor.
,containing many aspects financial analysis.
,especially model building part
,clear instruction useful python code applied case study.
,teacher congratulated teaching.
,nice practical course.
,well illustrated practical skills
,gusto es un curso muy completo
,hope enjoyed course
,
,generally informative course use python financial analysis.
,would recommend little basic finance background ideas statistics concepts vaguely explained course.
,sometimes instructor skips logical steps.
,would also nicer see coding happening live.
,promising good start financial analysis base statistics
,python part practical statistics quite difficult understand.
,
,good basic understanding python
,
,understand use python libraries functions compute statistical data.
,90% statistics 10% python.
,course really good course understand python programming 1.you need basic intermediate knowledge statistics 2. basic knowledge finance
,explanation better times difficult understand fresher
,aterriza es algo pr獺ctico que pueda utilizar para el an獺lisis
,considering dropping course switching udacity.
,"one simple reason: absolutely feedback homework assignment, except public chat room occasional hit-and-miss response teaching assistant."
,"teaching assistants cannot review code, so, specific question stuck - luck... help yourself."
,"even code works assigned, auto-grader give '0' 'how'/method use."
,way know correct ... go beginning review.
,assignments based video lectures course notes - research ton online get close supposed do.
,"again, support, q&a, explanations."
,black box.
,"*** take course complete beginner programming *** *** want deeper understanding programming, take first two u-michigan coursera courses (""python everybody"" series)."
,"good: course gives *very* concise overview basics python: conditionals, loops, lists, dictionaries, files."
,"such, ideal course experienced programmer new python, programming computer science."
,"or, review/refresher previously took python course looking strengthen they've already taught."
,"took already taken python courses elsewhere (namely, ""python everybody"" courses offered coursera u-michigan)."
,"goes material, substantive way."
,"bad: instructor clear, merely goes syntax python - basically works."
,go underlying framework computer programming (that transcends python).
,"such, new computer programming, even lost."
,"got programming background, may you."
,bad #2: course structured paced poorly.
,"""week"", watch ton 30 sec - 2 min videos, instructor *blazes* ton material."
,"weekly quizzes typical coursera (multiple choice, mostly recall, challenging)."
,*one* monster assignment end week.
,"problem approach throw bunch new concepts (in tiny 1 min videos), expect put together one monster assignment."
,"like explaining someone quickly components car, expecting fix one go."
,"showing someone list vocabulary foreign language, rules grammar, boom - expecting write essay one go."
,effective way learning cumulative - building one idea top other.
,deepens understanding.
,course instead feels like python cram course already know need refresher.
,bad#3: validation checks weekly assignments done poorly.
,"seems configured way *one* way reach result, need *one* way."
,"actually bad practice real world, often multiple ways code something get result, benefits tradeoffs."
,"learning often multiple ways get result essential, grading system account for."
,"suggestions improvement: 1. smaller, frequent, mini-assignments focus subset ideas taught, rather one monster assignment week."
,"also encourage people continue learn, effective allowing students accumulate concepts."
,"2. lectures (penn re-recording again), coursera re-label ""mixed"" ""intermediate""."
,"intro python, ""beginner"" course."
,really bad course.
,cancel subscription course explained anything detail.
,"never taken introductory course python before, would find course frustrating."
,"lack ""why"" things way certain formats used code along exercises never previous taught."
,tests also bit difficult grasp example given take them.
,"bit plug lay, note innately obvious."
,manageable course otherwise.
,"content place, chapters incredibly long, good course someone learning python."
,took refresher course still confused me.
,homework assignments joke.
,little information let know expected assignment.
,"present incorrect codes say, 'fix these;' seeming forget course beginners!!!!"
,late un-enroll stuck it.
,wish could sampled getting stuck headache course.
,"'""supposed"" beginner class, hw assignments prove class otherwise."
,"spend less hour reading/listening lectures, hours, case days, trying do/figure homework."
,"makes worst, lack guidance/help tas albeit lot listed."
,"help provided, responses vague difficult understand."
,almost even worth asking help.
,waste money paid get certificate.
,organized well.
,beginners course
,"gives minute video examples, gives long complicated assignment."
,"posted forum help, responses make sense seem assume experience actually do."
,"first assignment broken, got support fix it."
,auto grader pathetic.
,understand thing
,"ok. ""cram-school"", quality can't let link prestigious institute; every video lasts ~ 1 minute flying through, ending know it; teaching quality so-so due haste speech, can't really learn anything teaching; howework partially reflect taught hectic eating lots time must find clue elsewhere; grading program also robust user-friendly; get feeling homework representitive reality's need, playing around tricks time consuming ( even degree feeling waste time full-time worker), giving headache unneessary tricky points."
,"better enroll courses taught professors industry-experienced professionels, know teach efficiently."
,drop course.
,said person engineering background graduate degree wants brush programming.
,canceled subscription reason.
,complete beginner people like me.
,save time money new python.
,frustratingly basic course.
,"teaching style unengaging sounds like someone reading manual examples rather explaining complex topic links field whole, even learner interested python first place."
,"examples used intro python repetitive constant rehashing calculator logics calculations python, zero focus learner remember functions, pertain field coding use future."
,due monotonous unengaging manner teaching seem like effective course learn beginners users already understanding functions coding languages.
,can't wait enroll 100% online master penn u. instructor course shown great value introduction python programming.
,goodddd
,i've finished week3 really like i'm learning.
,"course, however, lacks one crucial element--solutions assignements completed minimum pass them."
,important?
,2 reasons.
,"1. even job programmer find what's wrong code using internet + trial error, job course teach us think code improve thinking, course do."
,2. multuple ways solving problem.
,"say, student figures one two them, one required testing mechanism."
,problem occurs next assignment requires use solution come with.
,start next task gaps knowldge could easily filled course creators.
,overall mind testing mechanism.
,"designed check corner cases, like idea adjusting code withstands tests."
,"however, find frustrating need rely trial error, course improve way think code."
,"despite that, still think course worthwhile i'm looking forward last assignment."
,"course still progress, reached stage quiz assessment ... unable sublit completeld subscription rules india, student persuing bachelor degree, earning yet."
,due lockdown karnataka state india parents work possible afford complete course paying.
,"so,please let access course free indeed helpme add certificate resume"
,course overall great!
,final assignment difficulut infact changed times since original creation.
,said i'd say final assignement fully pull everything learned final week what's bit advanced seem fit like assignements.
,"moreover, looking achallenge still consider beginner i'd recommend course even wanted audit it."
,fourth assignment clear.
,besides course great!
,great refresher python programming technical managers like me.
,hard task week 4 beginner... otherwise great!
,"lectures devoid meaningful information, redundant times really follow logical progression."
,"first hw assignment trivial, 2nd extremely difficult time consuming."
,difficult task trying figure hw really asking.
,main reason taking course versus taking one many highly rated free courses graded homework.
,hoping get meaningful feedback coding could improve.
,"well, homework peer graded feedback beneficial."
,"short, complete total waste time money."
,cover test important feature c++!
,"derived classes, namespaces, discussion stl special member functions, start."
,possible way passing practice final exam considered meaningful understanding c++.
,highly disappointed policy providing homework paid participants.
,seems gearing towards another means making bussiness comes education.
,"understand grading providing feedback requires effort fees charged required cover cost, like must option get access homework, allowing us apply learning maybe acceptable feedback certificate course completion."
,"currently, closed homework policy goes basic objectives mooc hope reconsidered."
,"slow, uninteresting inaccurate code."
,"course claims designed c programmers least years experience, yet considerable time used explain basic concepts like types, casts etc, less trivial concepts like object orientation told ""look wikipedia article."""
,also much uninteresting irrelevant material better read listened to.
,"worst all, code lectures full mistakes bad practices."
,little c++ course.
,even slides typos acceptable course representing university.
,c++ code weak well.
,learn c++ course.
,course pretty stupid beginners all.
,starts slow gets really tough second week.
,instructor give adequate information things teaching about.
,instructor examples practical contexts.
,"jump dijkstra second week, without clarity major c++ concepts examples, much expectation student switching c c++ first time."
,confusion deadline assignments.
,"many lectures later week courses, effort crunch everything week complete course."
,"spaced properly examples problems weeks, would help."
,sorry sir could'nt understand.
,course assumes basic knowledge c. really appreciate prof. ira pohl's approach explain things details fill gaps students might rather assuming everything perfectly clear.
,might find pace slow side please understand intended people various background experience.
,also appreciate way prof. pohl elaborates fundamental algorithms data structures clear well articulated manner.
,teacher exceptional.
,think i've seen many professors explains things well comprehensive manner.
,excellent course like learn basics c++ version 11. explanations excellent.
,would also suggest using c++ primer book details.
,course assignments bit time consuming without much hand-holding.
,audit class enrich modern c++ skill.
,class gives basic overview c++.
,think good class learner strong c background.
,skipped algorithm parts class main goal learn difference c c++.
,recommend practice c++ coding throughout course help learning experience.
,really helpul programming aspect.
,managed develop logical abilty course really helped me.
,would like thank prof. ira pohl excellent lectures course c++ c programmers part a. build c++ using c background gave good understanding various features c++ one make use features write programs good idiomatic programming style.
,lectures presented blend data structures algorithms provided much insight programming c++.
,looking forward part b course.
,looking long time c++ online curs.
,"although quite availeble different learning platforms, start either begining present brieflly modern features language."
,"one, presumming certain level knowledge c programming, satisfy need information regarding c++ programing language."
,professor actually cover lot useful stuff introduced latest versions c++ enhance ease coding.
,two assignments graph theory good learning experiences.
,programming background must take course since basic concepts assumed known.
,excellent course comparative learning c c++.
,usefull people already know lot things c c++ yet find difficult differentiate them.
,course also improves knowledge c++ sets foundation basics languages similar c++.
,"good courser, especially people like lot experience coding c program want learn something advance career."
,i'll recommend course friend.
,much needed course students strong fundamentals c programming lack oop skills c++.
,still scope improvement.
,"helpful someone like who's studied c university level, needs quick introduction unique concepts added c++."
,"excellent course, one best learning c++."
,"projects much fun, learned lot!"
,c programmer little knowledge c++.this course really helped correlate languages.
,drop course please assist good course hort time complete it.
,"really learned lot c++, great professor excellent material, looking forward part b"
,teacher good explain well deeply details.
,interesting detailed examples explained.
,easy understand!!
,good course c++ programmers.
,includes high level understandings.
,"first assignment easy, second assignment hard seems prerequisites graph theory."
,"enrolled c++ coursera learn c++, spend 2 weeks youtube wikipedia learn graph theory algorithms, courses corusera thank much!"
,"showing part code video help, write code vacuum, understanding parts operate together crucial too."
,find elaboration wikipedia scope review..
,interesting useful course like proficient c. c knowledge two previous courses specialization probably course quite complicated.
,definitely enroll second part.
,interesting effective.
,good occasion learn also side topics
,"great passion, great lecture."
,thank kind explanation.
,one great courses taken coursera.
,course alley-oop pass cs career.
,best c plus plus course c programmers.
,one best course thanks great learning
,can't reset ddl!!
,!it'is terrible
,"review c++,it's good"
,best c++ course ever
,good explanation ..
,would done best
,best video lectures
,really liked
,useful contents!
,test
,"course good exercises trivial, teacher speaks slowly accommodate native english speakers find fair."
,"course mixes bit graph theory teaching c++ language reckon good idea makes solving non trivial problems thus stressing c++ topics covered lecture, would case problems simpler."
,"big limit see course grading system peer-review system work well student's preparation uneven, can't expect much on-line course though."
,"draw conclusion sense learned something end course, rewarding, really appreciate work striving provide best knowledge everybody, think small revolution."
,"good course, content great well organized."
,slides code bit embarrassment university california.
,"code presented looks like power point slide bullets formatting alignment totally messed up, shortage typo's code errors."
,"but, material good ira pohl excellent job presenting it."
,great course exactly looking for.
,"course great, thing really annoys camera switches teacher talking rather remaining notes talking about."
,would much preferred notes teacher displayed simultaneously notes displayed heard talk.
,many times found copying something elaborating something look see notes replaced video teacher.
,professor pohl calm intuitive delivers info right away.
,smooth course c engineer coming mechatronics major (missing lot graph theory data structures).
,i'm glad enrolled course totally recommended!
,points improve: codes representation could improved readability.
,"c programmer, course gentle introduction world c++."
,programming exercises good opportunities rewrite c codes c++.
,"lectures rather fun, ira pohl good explaining, covers quite lot essential c++11 features."
,course good overall needs focus new things c++ algorithms.
,"would recommend course struggling c++,it goes throw basics tells stl works."
,homework hard big plus :)
,"excellente course, learnt lot history c++, different ways make easier pseudocode c++, importance c++"
,"actually introduced c++11 features well,it first course coursera benificial ways ."
,"helps transition c++ understanding reasons, simple recipe."
,wish could use realistic code used programs focus less obscure programming
,started another c++ course... hands require moment
,could better lectures hands programming examples.
,i've audit course.
,"helpful me, especially c++11 new things."
,explanation really good.
,contents could elaborate.
,quality presentation slides good.
,course detailed analysis c++
,good week 2 marked completed
,"pretty good course, learnt lot sure"
,alotof works survive
,"accomplishes main goal: help leap c c++, but: - damn slow."
,"use 1.5x 2x speed time, i'm native english.- format slides really ugly (e.g., bullet points code)- lecture notes provided- references (expensive) books instead- source code examples provided either- graph theory interesting, scope."
,waste time already know interested want learn c++.
,would better provide references optional reading reviewing.
,"must admit thought would gain basic knowledge c++ namespace discussions , oop , special pointers etc."
,exercises hard but... real grasp c++ advantages.
,"think i'll enroll part b moment im sure encouraged keep learning language also course, that's reason third star gave."
,much focus implementing graph algorithms little actually learning c++.
,homework assignments time allocation (2 * 2 hours) far enough able complete assignments.
,course presents topics non-linear manner.
,"called ""learning graphs c++"""
,amazing course helped lot
,focus history reduced.
,"me, suppose"
,little bit confusing
,much working
,detail.
,gave course two star taking responsibility.
,course bad designed.
,homework less clue may find 50% less related knowledge lectures.
,final quiz ridiculous (too many questions number calculation cannot believe questions like d. ritchie b. stroustrup e. dijkstra l. euler invent?!!!).
,seems professor assistant put much effort providing course.
,"though learned something pushed learn several c++ skills, google searching way."
,video sessions nice informative.
,"however, examples videos ""toy"" compared assignment implementing monte carlo simulation dijkstra's algo."
,directions description assignment poorly written specs blurry difficult clarify yourself.
,"mst assignment much easier, still directions well prepared."
,chinese subtitles really hard figure english subtitles knowledge.
,feel upset concerning chinese translation think improved sooner later.
,chinese learners like would learn much students english mother languages.
,"found know c++ limited extent, practical uses must learn significant amount information sources."
,"short, course introduction give enough tools call c++ programmer."
,instructor speaks slow.
,teaching concepts valid anymore.
,"prefer inline function call, const vs #define, declaring variable anywhere code etc... topics small much time devoted them."
,instructor way boring.
,i've tried hard watch lectures least thrice loose interest while.
,there's lack energy connection audience.
,low effort put designing course.
,lecture content useful part.
,assignments peer-reviewed instead designing test-cases.
,"lots overlap videos, lot information c++ features, hands-on activities features taught."
,good talks mood like teching us able understand concepts
,poorly designed course material.
,everything split up.
,much weaker stanford offerings.
,"strange buildup topics breezy, particular accurate understanding."
,example: multiple layers neural network introduced multiple category classification.
,transfer learning introduced incorrectly.
,matrix representation multiple features example multiple examples introduced late course.
,instructor conscientious seemingly knows material despite using non-standard terminology.
,one wonders primarily teacher/researcher rarely practitioner.
,one wonders duke leader machine learning research.
,"course okay, teaching helpful explaining concepts machine learning well."
,problem connections theory practice.
,assignments pytorch completely decoupled course materials explained well.
,expect code model directly mathematical theory poor explanation pytorch framework syntax.
,wrong thing happen us.coursera tolds course free due 9th birthday celebration.but time claiming certificate .its shows us buy certificate.this cheating .i hate app ..
,really amazing field learn new things institute like amazing i've learnt ...it's boring we'll excited future experience ?
,"concepts gradient descent convolutions pertain neural networks explained without going mathematical details but, opinion, explained intuitively better, compared courses."
,course include ungraded jupyter notebooks exemplifying key elements deep learning networks.
,highly recommended 'cement' understanding neural networks.
,learning course loved coz depth knowledge machine learning.
,week 1 covers almost fundamentals topics lays solid foundation learner ml.
,"looking forward enjoy learning course attentively, complete assignments."
,good course explaining theoretical concepts related deep learning .
,would like thank prof. carin lucid intuitive explanation major concepts machine learning covered class.
,best explanation concepts cnn reinforcement learning found far !!!
,also little bit disappointed set programming exercises end lectures teachers.
,"think instead giving students examples programming using raw, low-level tensorflow apis overwhelms main concepts."
,better use high-level back end tool like keras (not slim !!!)
,"would prefer practical, lectures step step practice machine learning real dataset (problems)."
,see generally coursera emphisises theory rather practical.
,"came assesment quit, spend much time understand framework works."

,hey guys.
,i've seen new session started enrolled write review little story myself.
,i've taken course years ago ( august 2013) recent changes coursera (specializations etc.).
,"moment finishing university realized - clue willing life (my primer occupation ""manager"" - like that's depressing enough :) ."

,"looked assignments, thought asked put paper things already thinking anyway."
,"given untimely low quality peer feedback first assignment, feel like i'd learn anything completing submitting assignments."
,"refuse buy webcam coursera (i phone capability coursera app support identity verification), can't get certification anyway."
,"thought content interesting, basic pay for."
,"major value see certification path extensive feedback capstone project, thought peer feedback came late extensive enough valuable."
,think instructor good job presenting content
,2/4 modules already 2 links reading material defunct course made.
,one article behind paywall ny times link 2015 broken completely.
,google search article led redundant results going back broken link several professors linked similar online course sylabbus
,"reviewing process quite slow, thus wait someone review assignment grade it, even complete course 1 week can't pursue certificate 1 week review assignment 3-4 days minimum one."
,"coursera improve problem, overall teaching quality great."
,"good course somebody knows absolutely nothing presented subjects ( like networking, embedded software etc."
,everything explained way grandmother could understand it.

,gives need know.
,expected more.
,"wider grasp things, additional readings, quiz?, related articles, links on."
,maybe mandatory addition already there.
,course good instructor reads slides.
,instructor show examples hand.
,"example: talking python c++ difference write simple python c++ code explain writing, creating diagrams on.. i'm satisfied slides bad."
,felt basic.
,"took week, i'd time could done day."
,hope rest specialization in-depth.. also forums.. makes impossible interact questions.
,pros:- gives brief overview iot ecosystem.
,dr. harris teaches complex things easy manner.
,cons:- assignments available audit students.
,request coursera open assignments audit students well.
,"decent introductory class, way much information repeated wireshark peer reviewed assignment even work properly tutorial date."
,course far much introductory practical assignments challenging enough.
,yet introductory course iot specialization.
,"sometimes easy, may good start point."
,video lessons long amount shared information.
,starts simplistically.

,well wait peer graded assignments.
,good overview landscape iot.
,"gread course, shows basic iot."
,want unenroll course
,best explanation far :)
,like lesson.
,class extreme example introduction subject - basic information.
,"would guess anyone actually knows term ""internet things"" able find course already knows content presented here."
,"completeness ensuring everyone page, suppose required."
,"took one star basic, yet drawn-out information (it could covered single week)."
,"two stars came tedious peer-review assignments little add understanding content (it hard understand, assignment ends busy work)."
,two stars gave instructor seems knowledgable rest specialization looks promising.
,"information presented useful interesting, hard call course."
,"could see instead done 2 videos, 30 minutes long presented introduction next course series."
,course though excellently presented explained.
,"peer review is, often case, something gamble."
,"popular course, peer reviews completed least, resulting grades look like something rng."
,"thought material presented overly high level particularly useful, particularly second half course."
,add detail.
,"furthermore, presentation style professor engaging, address interesting archetypes examples lectures."
,early material fine presentation could dramatically improved.
,"lastly, assignments rather interesting early quality decreased course progressed."
,quite theoretical.
,"well explained, useless."
,"tries cover many theoretical areas connected iot, never gets practice."
,"hand-on, thought."
,"i'm interested already programmer (lecturing program) know theory, interested practical aspects iot"
,"course address elementary issues iot, instructor times seems like good grasp lecture materials."
,"access quizzes evaluations auditing participant, shame since coursera moocs allow access evaluation material auditing modality."
,2 * technical issue faced videos loading properly .
,stuck somewhere audio continuing .
,couldnt finish course.
,apart teaching really good.
,hope guys work fix it.
,"overall good course beginner much theoretical things there, one needs push practicals."
,cup tea way less practical way theoretical modules specialization.

,sleuth assignments frustrating.
,"bit theory could provided, examples creating events, initializing objects etc."
,"want learn programming computer science, waste time course."
,"instead, go cs50x."
,th instructions given clear discussions enough fully understand course
,"fan javascript ""game"" itself, way specific cases"
,find examples referencing could get support
,i've better.
,giving course single star review coursera charged course twice.
,signed monthly subscription course finished three weeks.
,week finished charged again.
,charged course i've completed!?
,"make matters worse, cannot even go process requesting refund coursera's link ( ""learner help center"") requesting help refunds broken."
,"everytime click link, logs brings home page."
,fact way speaking receiving help issue right.
,feel robbed.
,"tried audit course advertised part university london thousands pounds worth bachelor degree program pop windows coursera, curious."
,"found instructions first videos confusing, versions brackets provided instructions run shown videos, get errors time, can't figure what's wrong ask questions, clear examples (like 'sketch') taken from."
,confusing right start hoping beginners like myself.
,better taking duke course detailed comes javascript pick html css side front end development
,"links working, using examples us code work."
,course needs work.
,frustrate new people.
,teach anything.
,"course incredibly unorganized, download folders match lectures, enough information given try follow along."
,sleuth assessment isnt really good.
,tons users (including me) complaining solved task still getting error message.
,upsetting brackets would work windows.
,really wanted learn outdated program allow to.
,terrible video content.
,"changing background time distracting viewer, person mostly saying ""what learned"" every video instead talking subject."
,"diagrams, flows data shown etc., person speaking bragging; slides purely unprofessionally prepared."
,level prepared content primary school uni.
,could write hours stop.
,hope believe sample real content real study paying 600 pounds.
,"compare content example 30 pounds machine learning stanford university, get pdfs slides, complete written notes, detailed prepared pdf rich content assignments professor actually talks content, becomes bit strange."
,enjoy mooc would introduce friends.
,think course revolutionize previous understanding computer internet.
,thumb up!
,good course introduction computing.
,"could stand challenging, material certainly easy enough true beginner."
,one worst courses i've encountered.

,"much examples, inadequate teaching materials, lecturer giving us links main websites really elaborating lecture."
,"discussion forums means stuck assignment/lecture, own."
,peer grading review delays progress since wait classmate's review may take while(not much available reviewers).
,professor speaks fast many things understood requires previous knowledge.
,although assignments easy anyone them.
,good place start arduino intro good little short c 4 weeks enough grasp right bat anyway back next session catch c finish couple short c videos asked write programs little knowledge basicly 3- 7 min lectures language easy kinda lost first im 60 yrs old twenty !!!
,im reading online libraries totally limited arduinos ide nd really c arduino c lot workings arduino ide easier new people alot inner workings hidden tough learn inner workings unlike full featured ide good platform start basics tidbits id rather go later c++ spend time get better platform arm pic boards real ides real c + something use real world bigger programs see staying arduino long going platforms could cause bad programing habits start writing limited code seems productive get electronics coding hardwhare experience go right real deal pic arm boards much steeper learning curve great figure learn electronics get hardwhare experience course arduino im seeing pros even advanced platforms run bigger faster programs dont bootloader many pros use arduino first layout test circuits first good course gets digging thinking start certainly cant start advanced platforms right really almost impossible without lot skill obtain first

,"taking class, often wondered target audience was."
,"although class listed prerequisites, noticed lot engineering jargon used without ever defining meant."
,i'm sure non-technical people would get much lectures.
,"hand, lectures mostly superficial level, i'm sure technical people would get much either."
,"topic got (somewhat) deep dive serial communication, clear why; users arduino need understand less aspect arduino works.there issues."
,programs wrote pasted submission form removed carriage returns hit save; manually fix program time.
,"perhaps frustratingly, could follow assignment instructions letter, submitted might find grading criteria included requirements."
,"one case people asked it, turned grading criteria wrong, never updated."
,sense much effort went creation course.
,"but, think worth pay 61 dollar couple hours lectures, finish 1 day."
,"i'm really disappointed fact, possible go quizes assignments without payment."
,"can't pay right now, able pay end receive certificate?"
,"go course late assignments, wait another course session... very-very inconvenient."
,"and, yep, coursera reduce effect learning providing quizes auditing only."
,decent course introduction arduino.
,liked fact pre-requisites understanding.
,would good able see actual examples would work interfacing components.
,"fas ""c programming"" portion concerned, coverage would great."
,"overall, good course someone trying get started understanding arduino."
,actually helpful familiar arduino although opinion could advance course get information coding problems happen every time working arduino .
,generally helpful appreciate course
,one hand - basics.
,"other, may lost last part course."
,"need understand complete assigements, netherless - hard understand experience embedded systems topic"
,"interface classes straight, flexible."
,"almost looks like real classroom, good case we're home learning ourselves."
,"still, good content."
,detailed insight topics required felt.
,whole great resource student community want start microcontroller exploration arduino.
,good course beginners give general information arduino hopping actually practice debugging instead knowing general information
,good according paucity arduino programming enrolled .
,however still helpful enjoyed .
,professor seems pretty nice class great even quizzes/answers assignments available payment
,curso 矇 bom.
,faltam exemplos pr獺ticos.
,繳nico que t礙m 矇 bom pra quem nunca teve contato com eletr繫nica.
,"expected programs taught experiments shown, disappointing"
,practical least till end course specialization
,"pretty high level, c programming instruction horrendous."

,ha gustado bastante como iniciacion arduino
,good enough arduino programming basics
,fantastic good start arduino
,expected advanced.
,great amount content
,nice easy course.
,good exposure
,good videos
,good.....
,"first part course good, think lacked projects really projects using arduino."
,"besides, last week debugging (with lot detail) think makes much sense go lot detail debugging learnt yet sketches complex enough advanced debugging necessary.the course felt easy times, others complex (using specific terminology , specially last week)."
,"said, believe lecturer clear engaging presenting material."
,6 courses specialization .
,first two almost completely theoretical little practical knowledge.
,theory boring unnecessary.
,completing two courses(one audited one sponsored school) pay huge amount remaining courses since course teach much chose continue pay finish specialization.
,entry level course c plus programming expectations jump considerably.
,"quizzes video lectures helpful understading hardware software, final project seem build believed basic familiarity arduino would help, unable complete final project."
,"teacher basically assumes already know quite bit, goes basics, cover detail."
,"completely new arduinos, course actually help"
,course barely touches c programming.
,"explanatory arduino functions structure, spread weeks could cover more."
,"bad introduction, already know bit programming get basics learn quickly book."
,good starting course needs move beggining bits something useful less theoretical
,much practical oriented.
,theory teaching vague able understand much.
,"forum, support, end feel prepared assignments."
,simple lack practice exercises!
,little hands arduino.
,theoretical
,muito bom pena que n瓊o tem meu idioma
,enough detail
,superficial
,"honest opinion, 90% course content totally irrelevant."
,instructor focuses heavily explaining stuff rather stuff.
,"furthermore, course title says ""the arduino platform c programming"" actually course gives sufficient attention c arduino itself."
,"instead, focused heavily concepts important programmer learning arduino embedded systems general uart, data sent serially steps towards creation hex file."
,"addition, attention given actual arduino coding even single relevant task given."
,course almost nothing.
,seems teacher make enough preparations make lot mistakes couse.
,8 weeks arduino-related courses i've got almost nothing new besides first 2 chapters arduino starter kit book.
,"truly terrible introduction c. can't already program c, know difference c c++ even know call c/c++ struggle."
,information free better presented places.
,deber穩an avisar que se pueden subir para calificar los cuestionarios ni las tareas sin pagar.
,"esto en la semana 1, ya veremos si hay m獺s sorpresas en las siguientes."
,unfortunately course designed poorly.
,"lectures generally good, enough materials."
,"i'm sorry say, programming assignments bad."
,"forum full posts like ""grader grades file 100 50 points""."
,"teaching stuff reacts like, quote: ""hi anton, may missed see question text?"
,"something help with?"""
,"yes, dear teaching stuff, help anton, us."
,"take look parallel programming using scala, here, coursera."
,"grader stable, apparently well-known, common way reaching stable state jvm using testing frameworks."
,measure performance stable state reached.
,"also, clear actually topic course?"
,parallel programming?
,almost nothing common parallel programming.
,"info hardware, schedulers, operating systems, jvm."
,java?
,"also no, information language, specific parts, implementation threads, words said jvm, actually jvm event mentioned."
,"so, then, course about?"
,"may say course ""a good introduction parallel programming""."
,hope next course specialization get much better.
,course well organized teaches up-to-date techniques java parallelization.
,material covered course used immediately java programmers.
,instructor organized videos video short covers one point.
,examples show value taught apply taught.
,"every video also comes summary ""this learned video""."
,"missed details understand it, video summary helpful me."
,highly recommend course introduction parallel programming.
,course great balance theoretical practical method.
,programming java really great.
,familiar java like assignment quit challenging.
,need know basic api get used java documentation.
,"useful concept async future course help understanding parallel programming java, download language x10 please accept gratitude."
,ability disassemble fingers difficult problem ability truly talented teachers
,"course lots invaluable insights, in-depth materials high level concepts practice."
,highly recommend course programmers want familiarize java parallel programming.
,"well-made videos, good explanation concepts, great hands-on projects (not difficult)."
,"issues w/ differences b/t dev grader environments terms performance / tests passing, that's inevitable."
,"excellent course, applying principles real life programming gives boost confidence.changed way thinking"
,"course good, teaching simple way several complex questions."
,fundamental core concepts lucidly setforth teacher.
,good course learn parallel programming java
,precise comprehensive time

,great content mentors
,helpful advanced
,赲?? ?郋?郋?郋
,"excellent course.i always wanted good course java concurrency parallel programming.and finish->async, isolated, forasync constructs awesome.i learnt much course."
,"great material, well arranged course flow, willing teacher, nice project snippets."
,coding samples projects could included.
,lecturer wear black shirt make video readable.
,much abstract pseudocode java course.
,"third test, implemented solution documentation given ""pcdp framework"", also, implementation run faster, doubts ""framework""."
,"grader accurate, spent hours trying find way improve code last miniproject one uploaded failed 4 cores test, uploaded passed test... suggest improve examples phasers, maybe would better introduce low complexity problems examples step step explanation works and... threads came from?"
,never explain threads course.
,"definitively, course can't called ""specialization"" good course starters."
,"course interesting, lacks contents: patterns explained, concepts parallelism, little details algorithms."
,"assignments, projects particular, quite useless incredibly easy, need usage knowledge libraries explained/used course, included ""optional readings""."
,lessons really clear (bravo!
,"professor), quite short, since whole course reach 2 hours lesson."
,definitively think course improved contents.
,"interesting, presentations, support materials programming exercises issues."
,"i'm fond usage pseudo code, java course."
,"want example use existing java libraries, preferably standard java jdk."
,"exercises, addition unit tests test performance code, would valuable tests run quickly, test code computes correctly."
,"week 4, provided test took 9 minutes run."
,unit test take second most.
,"lectures adequate understand basic concepts/syntax use them, go deep underlying working."
,"mini projects helpful since assignments examples shown lecture, todos generally couple lines, leaving us little do."
,"end course, got know different java util classes use parallelism."
,"course, order understand material satisfactory way, often go search materials."
,material presented superficial way.
,consider weakness.
,"hand, terms breadth, covers lot useful topics, broadened perspective parallel programming world."
,"thing would suggest improve assignments, error messages always sufficient information recreate bug caused error, hard correct bug (since recreate bug, find root cause)."
,"hand understandable, giving away much info grader makes easier ""workaround"" failed test without necessarily providing good solution."
,tricky trade-off.
,"anyway, lecturers good job explaining fairly complex stuff ways non-computer-science students understand."
,"like courses series, lectures exercises excellent."
,"coming communications background, course presented opportunity build already knew also offered new interesting insights related algorithm performance tuning."
,course nice mix theory serviceable information.
,"never done type high-performance computing, nice gentle introduction subject."
,instructions took lot time build fun interesting exercises meticulously constructed.
,course fairly advanced would need review materials many times understand concept.
,assignments definitely fun straightforward courses.
,"excellent course, good way showcase scala well suited patallel programming."
,course practical instructors knowledgeable
,"course simple, second assignment hard."
,"made through, happy achievement."
,must take opinion better deep understanding parallel programming.
,good hands-on course.
,best parallel programming line course far see.
,"learning parallel programming, learn spark flink."
,great material.... easy understand examples...
,crisp point.
,enjoyed thoroughly
,one point improve: lib scala told install use
,"good general, theory part complexity tedious"
,friendly beginners scala.
,presented tons scala code minimal detailing algorithms.
,obviously lecture expects quite familiar java scala.
,lecture informative either (at least green hands scala).
,"found best way works pause slide, study code, go see lecture say."
,presentaba los topicos que deseaba.
,"ya deseo el cruso, se muestra como darme de baja."
,"deep lectures, exercises complex problems parallel programing"
,"much imperative technics ""functional"" parallel programming course."
,"course good, believe content didactic."
,"looks good, updated."
,talking swift 2 coming soon newest version swift 4.2.
,"course updated - version xcode cannot higher 7.3.1, version compatible latest macos mojave."
,opinion course updated removed list paid specialization.
,course uses swift 2.x xcode 7.x.
,"versions 2016 certain aspects swift xcode changed dramatically, point one sample playgrounds work new versions."
,"time writing, 2019 gap big something relatively easy update."
,sadly outdated.
,can't install xcode 7.3.1 mojave.
,course seriously outdated.
,"runs xcode 7 swift 2, swift 5 here!"
,course updated.
,"xcode already version 9 2018, still using xcode 7. swift already 4 2018, still using swift 2. sad course material keeps saying ""we aware xcode already version 8, please stick xcode 7 now."
,"xcode 8 break code""."
,sadder know knowledge learn course apply modern technology.
,"one thing, course forum poorly maintained."
,many people asking questions one really answering.
,course teaches everything swift 3. macbook cannot install xcode 7 swift 3 wants latest version even though found xcode 7 online.
,basically point taking course wasted 2 weeks
,"material old, version xcode 11.4 course ask xcode 7, get it, able install recent os mojave catalina"
,requires xcode 7.3.1 work updated macos.
,course needs updated remain usable.
,work modern versions macos
,outdated course !
,worthless
,date
,outdated
,"course needs updated tell int introduction needed, like macbook, os use, way much time trying install old software course."
,horrible!!!!!
,removed immediately!!!!!
,seems instructor jack wu prepare course material.
,decided continue course explicitly recommended course taught using swift 2 (now 5) deprecated xcode version.
,"want spent time learning new thing then, learn again."
,"excellent course, update swift 4 excellent experience"
,"es un curso viejo, sus herramientas son obsoletas para el 2021"
,short course covered things required basic swift programming.
,basic information provided xcode tool shortcuts used.
,looking forward interesting content future topics.
,hand teachers deep need lot selfstudy.
,would recommend ones without basic knowledge cs.
,amazing course awesome material.
,great way start learning basics swift getting know people aspiration learning new stuff.
,god far second week happy pleased content also lecturers educated calm.
,strongly recommended
,debugger video showed awesome tools i've never known about.
,thanks mentioning view hierarchy debugger mode.
,easy grasp new programming language.
,"swift programming concepts closures, optionals clearly explained."
,i've looking relevant courses long time.
,can't find better course one.
,"great far, love approach teaching swift going building apps , definitely recommend"
,great free course.
,would want material practical exercises paid course.
,"great people prior programming experience java, c++, javascript."
,"great course, i'd like it.. study basic swift thanks lot course..."
,conversations time confused!
,general course great!
,"complete specific, offers adequate level complexity"
,instructors talking about.

,falta mas ejercicio practicos.
,good course swift.
,good swift basic
,"now, good"
,jack best ...
,simply awesome.
,cool !!
,ilove
,great course first all.
,one problem course probably going lectures.
,"lectures explaining fundamental basics swift,which really useful, comprehensive enough."
,"students, believe, lot self-studying finish final project."
,"still, final project challenging interesting."
,"swift hard language learn, went lectures read books swift programming, able finish project."
,course really swift introductory.
,important concept demonstrated without significant portion practice with.
,"see lecturer playground, homework student really understand concept."
,teases us dive next specialization course.
,"perfect anyone wants know swift like is, decide whether want snorkle dive."
,"since introduction swift programming believe contain information particular topics, depth essence course."
,"provided official swift apple documentation, i'm wondering short course necessary (read necessary know everything beginning) know everything swift language."
,content absolutely amazing.
,really like last assignment curve ball students class.
,little preparation thus took understand get started it.
,"liked it, everything well described, clear helpful."
,last assignment description clear.
,peer review reviewing criteria clear well.
,could understood many ways.
,enhance peer review instructions.
,"course overall useful learned lot, although component self-learning essential succeed."
,"think would ideal peer assignment would allow shades grading, ""yes"" ""no""."
,"i'm taking simultaneously others specialization, think right decision."
,"great quick intro, definitely ideal newbies programming."
,"although i've programming experience, course's assignment easy complete."
,recommend study object-oriented language java c++ taking course.
,"great starter course, reading materials great way learn directly source clearer understanding thanks videos."
,course good start swift programming ios.
,"help lot, much time devote."
,appreciate this.
,"nice course, would better examples thought demonstration, rather extempore."
,good classic scala functional programming (being simply awesome) still good.
,"unnecessary swift vs objective c session, provide value - otherwise fairly good basic course"
,"idea swift, even much idea oop."
,got good idea swift.. assignments improved.
,required things swift programming language needed ios development present course
,hope next courses detailed.
,hard understand things without experience.
,well course tell programming swift.
,"good content, updated reflect latest version xcode swift."
,"quite fun, easy quick."
,already object oriented programming knowledge.
,nice easy introduction.
,already got programming background.
,bit short goes straight point.
,"classes entertaining, sometimes little messy."
,"updated, old version."
,excellent option beginners.
,awesome course great explanation
,course good interactivity)
,"nice course, rather fast pace!"
,awesome basic course
,almost great!
,far less staid traditional academic teaching formats science field.
,surprised actually anaged get introductory module end course less inclined want attempt end module project simply instructions really provided sufficient indicators guided newcomers subject programming science field seems norm many introductory programming courses.
,maybe people teaching forgotten like start beginning recall time thought surely better way teach subject makes connection theory practice relative interconnection much like bitesize stepping stones links plausible achievable option unfamiliar field computer science.
,sure aspect seems fall short cs reason does.
,"imagine course many people either familiar fundamentals programming and/or aufait cs concepts whole already acquired necessary basic skill set / knowledge base programming, find subject teachings rather informative move forward development programming languages format writing programs depict much simpler approach compared languages."
,"sadly, complete beginner cs this, opinion, fails sufficiently guide assist newcomers building confidence later embark project draws subject topics taught thus far end bit shame tends dampen enthusiasm interested field computer science lack clarification aspects relate factors become clear faced daunting task end module project may find non-plussed wondering topic relates task final project?"
,"sure people inclined disagree opinion is, all, opinion, giving subject taster try, end result me, teaching methods good appeared relaxed format offered far enjoyable way teaching/learning subject that, felt, attempted invoke entice people interest cs sparked perhaps aiming offer route build foundations programming language final week case well thrown information way, decipher need apply part final project done guise problem solving."
,latter plausible concept would find perhaps applicable later specialisation develop knowledge/skills.
,"incorporated first module pathway seems is, seems like introductory programming courses invoke, and, quite leap embark upon especially without first offered stepping stones sufficient enough feel certain adequate understanding able sift information provided subsequently decide upon aspects relevant order attempt accomplish tasks set ultimately form complete final project."
,"actually guided experts whose teachings highlight newcomers practical visual sessions actually begin learn interconnections link chunks informational topics - form essential fundamental building blocks - doing, perhaps perceived initial 'spoon fed' approach enables newcomer build sufficient skills knowledge able actually 'develop' confidence."
,without essential basic foundational mixture possible engage newcomers enough determine feel equipped attempt final project?
,stepping stone approach surely effective way equip person new subject field broaden knowledge base.
,"alas, cs seems falling flat face speak preferential approach learning field study."
,shame highly intellectual people create courses forget like start beginning time takes guidance needed order person able feel like ready dive give topic like whirl.
,"like said, opinion interconnection building knowledge base falls short early stage development."
,choose course beginner.
,course beginningers.
,"start second week, course assumses students background cs without explaining basic concepts cs."
,"many feedback said before, version syntax super old many things changed."
,asking customer services quit couse.
,hours content across five weeks.
,whole course done single evening.
,"however, try starting programming experience likely extremely hard complete."
,since course prerequisite already code issue anyone.
,resource starting swift.
,video quality often poor.
,examples bit contrived.
,"generally, presentations better prepared, much figuring things video."
,good choice project practical.many interesting coding practice tidbits along way needs polish.
,"think good given reference material readings, exonerate explaining details language, wanted learn swift apple's documentation would right now, here, i'm watching course expect learn here."
,"videos poorly done, hard follow practicing playground time."
,"also, optional material, required completing assessment, bit unfair."
,material covered videos basic able apply principles larger programme.
,think course based image processing name course introduction swift programming image processing common.
,"could teach database, feed kind essential things."
,"course requires old version macos xcode, cannot readily imitate macos."
,"instructions stress this, selected another course specialization uses date versions xcode macos."
,"teaching content level required complete final project, frustrated beginners also stop finishing whole course."
,pity!
,"material ok, video quality regular instructors childish."
,prefer android specialization instructors mature professional.
,basic language features covered course.
,lot external links apple.com date course.
,professors talk fast english speak often difficult.
,extra stress: swift english
,"tedious introduction, delayed second week."
,hope following section better.
,"good introduction, would even better presentation swift."
,wish would materials practice with.
,i'd like practice tasks course final one
,course really need examples final assignment
,like much two teacher
,materials outdated
,covers basics
,completed assignment many hours trial & error; suggestions improving class future sessions.
,increase length depth lectures materials needed assignment covered.
,"week, optional programming exercise (not graded) model answer (with explanations why) students concrete example practice key concepts on."
,"classes & structs important completing assignment (instead including swift manual chapter classes & structs follow reading), include actual lecture topic."
,improve description assignment completed.
,specific required (e.g.
,; interface mean?
,user interface specified variable changed program code?
,mean order applying filters?
,mean variable lets decide order filters executes filters accordingly ability manually rearranging order calling functions code suffice?)
,improve alignment assignment review criteria.
,assignment asks five filters matching criterion review criteria.
,"based current review criteria, creating two filters would suffice demonstrate ability order get full points varying intensity 1 filter."
,hope remainder modules better otherwise extremely disappointed !
,"course little haphazard, ambling preview tiny bit swift."
,useful content class organization poor almost evidence course design use teaching techniques expected see major university.
,"best section course week 5, syntax objective-c swift superficially compared."
,section give clear opinions swift chosen objective-c new development.
,"sections contained many confusing, unrehearsed diversions esoteric topics much use."
,ended getting apple documentation swift class.
,"however, instructors received ample feedback nature seem genuinely concerned improving course."
,"assuming make major improvements next round noting coursera's infrastructure excellent, scared take class."
,"email reminders coursera assignments, etc... kept track kept class."
,sure familiar content expert programmer looking overview new language would perfect need understand swift starting introduction swift.
,"lessons felt unstructured, unplanned ad hoc almost like people presenting know recorded, meant examples given contrived without consideration suitability present concept succinctly would require anyone existing swift programmer needing carry additional reading rather defeats purpose ""introduction to..."" course."
,little scripting lesson planning preparation content would made difference excellently produced edited course awkward effort attend really useful reference beginers swift programming.
,"summarise, obviously expert technical knowledge speakers quality editing let rushed lesson content."
,course needs major improvement.
,lectures included errors code.
,"showing code video lectures instructor quick delete code, giving time students view understand shown."
,"dec 15, two weeks due date final project, large portions weeks course changed, requiring going back complete new lectures."
,adjustment made due date.
,requirements final project vague confusing able submit final project due date 2 hours.
,issue addressed need consider adjusting star rating.
,experience casts negative impression coursera platform university toronto teaching staff.
,i'm disappointed.
,lectures course seem unorganized often poor audio.
,content covered many lectures seemed topic.
,quiz questions would focus topic information making confusing regard material focus lecture.
,focus proposed subject video many tangents topics.
,combined unorganized nature videos(just winging it) made lectures distracting.
,lecture videos full code simply work real world help staff takes literally days get(and weekend).
,videos poorly done leave lot useful details out.
,zero support staff forums.
,"take course, plan spending lot time research external sources order gain understanding broad lacking detail videos."
,"improve course, instructors should: -provide links least one textbook swift -add mentors course help students forums -include repository code snippets practice concepts"
,"worst, think well developed course."
,"felt like informal conversation instructors one repeatedly calling different aspects swift ""cool""."
,also thought tests vaguely worded final assignment long definitely 30 minutes said would take complete it.
,"difficult challenges, felt like final project badly designed/described."
,un-enrolling.
,might great choice already familiar swift programming!
,"huge gap week 1-4 week 5, words first 4 weeks, learn syntax idea swift programming sudden write program 50 lines code."
,would recommend offer details practices first weeks course writing complicated program.
,coding assignments weekly would helpful.
,quizzes often asked information never presented lessons.
,instructors never present forums answer questions.
,final project asked us things even mentioned course materials.
,reason got 2 stars instead 1 learn swift.
,"probably guys big amount work, course looks extremely raw."
,half lectures time talking nothing seems lecture plan shooting video.
,"would ok course free, expected much price."
,"thank work, but, think, need keep improving quality course."
,course polished courses coursera.
,occasionally give examples small see video.
,quizes dealt syntax.
,feel like new skill developed taking it.
,"interested ios programming take university california, irvine versions class."
,lectures fairly light assignments throughout course reinforce material.
,mostly introduce concepts point apple swift documentation.
,really go much detail.
,final assignment good getting feet wet poorly specified.
,"honest opinion, quality course high."
,"expect learn basic syntax swift, that's it."
,"little material week, get quiz, best form examination learning."
,course thorough accompanies good programming exercises well..at starting course also cross talk among instructors.
,module image processing reviewed point becomes sort boring.
,professors prepared classes.
,make many mistakes video lectures also laughts middle course send non-professional feeling students.
,"content course good, proffesors could really better."
,little bit light really challenging.
,quick view language.
,"teaching team seems really organized : quick view language, slide, someone presenting code screen, real support forum teaching team."
,already learned swift syntaxs took course xcode thought course made much complicated actually is.
,also expected us know certain things work classes even explained.
,lecture professor instead bs student.
,also prepare slides explain swift details.
,exercises needed weeks lecture.
,"hopefully, course improve next time."
,found instead giving general idea ideas terms lecturers using seems like assuming already familiar lot concepts going over.
,course content old forces use obsolete version xcode.
,class material (examples) longer available download.
,instructors engaged forum monitoring seems almost non-existent.
,"poor video quality, weak, ad hoc examples, well thought flow."
,seems like tutors spent time proper preparation.
,free courses itunesu (especially stanford university) far better.
,audited course curiosity.
,"good start, week two teacher rambles, gets track explains less."
,would like see course little better prep recording.
,"think course could much better without jack wu, laughing every seconds."
,would except professional approach videos likely taken first shot errors.
,felt like teachers putting much time preparation - felt random disorganized.
,finish course - i'll watch cs193p lectures stanford instead.
,pair review really way go.
,"horse power check yourself, create automated tests pass like courses."
,outdated technology peer peer evaluation method abandoned.
,automated grading system like courses?
,course outdated!
,swift 2!
,"today learning swift 5, right?"
,even look rest course after.
,"far introductory, think course extension ios app development basics"
,"impressed course far, let's see rest specialisation."
,severely outdated.
,also different audio level different modules.
,quality course expected coursera course.
,donot mac imac hence wish opt out.
,apologies.
,course outdated
,"obsolete, swift 2"
,caotic.
,poor quality
,knowledgeable educators.
,course given q&a style good web based course since questions often exactly want ask.
,"however, think course still improved, especially following aspects."
,(1) examples course thought ahead.
,"instead, educators came spot."
,"way may best example convey message, plus videos made unnecessarily long way."
,think good programming course show real time programming sometimes.
,time bit much therefore inefficient.
,"comparing courses, think one could really benefit educators could give thought teach, especially think student perspective."
,"example: capability overwriting defining new operators, example given define knife operator overload plus operator stew vegetables."
,examples make much sense me.
,"although understand nice one define his/her operation/operator, examples came actually got confused -- stew vegetables code??"
,(2) quiz questions find useful.
,course need lots time complete quiz contrast coursera courses did.
,need actually read documentation order answer quiz questions since really depth.
,"way, quiz actually way learn."
,"questions quite artificial, example, there's multi-choice question ""what different ways one find help..."" (3) finally, find video quiz abstract."
,difficult follow without making line code myself... also clear educators expect pre-requisite taking course.
,sometimes things explained listeners programming background all.
,"time, concept explained fast wonder whether known objective-c order follow course..."
,i'm dropping course poorly conceived.
,"three weeks in, can't really articulate i've actually learned (which leads believe answer ""not much"")."
,major problem course clear objective.
,mean individual lessons objectives - actually mean entire course know wants instructors seem bypassed critical question.
,"background python, impression course would teach program swift (seems like fairly straightforward goal)."
,"summarize course (perhaps little uncharitably, i'm annoyed time wasted) would be: dudes computer talk cool features programming language."
,i'm fairly baffled fact thought put examples might best illustrate features trying teach.
,"which-examples-might-best-illustrate-the-feature-i-am-trying-to-teach pedagogy 101. would regularly work examples conclude ""actually that's bad example""."
,pretty strong evidence lesson planning involved.
,"also practice exercises, posting pieces illustrative code, hence, way actually get good programming swift (unless self directed, case - bother formality taking course coursera?"
,course poorly designed.
,course programming language jumps first use debugger went wrong program?
,"introducing swift, introducing xcode (and terrible job it)."
,"also, using xcode swift 8 months producing really good work, could get 3/7 quiz written questions purpose tricking people instead reinforcing checking knowledge content."
,"teach new application, consider introducing interface first."
,"explain various areas are, needed for, control them."
,orients user application helps find way around trying reinforce teachings later.
,presentation course unprofessional.
,like running commentary movie instead educational presentation.
,"felt like listening two geeks stuffing around good time, instead people professional teachers!"
,i'm incredibly disappointed course.
,back wonderful work paul hegarty stanford university itunes university youtube me.
,university toronto - really consider teaching staff unleash world.
,think somebody prior knowledge course find difficult understand.
,"taken introductory courses swift programming much elaborating this; instance, part ""i think"" week 4 jack wu explains closures, functions, enums, structs... less 10min, studied around 5 hours atleast visual tutorials online."
,"last lecture image processing, instructor gave 16minutes tutorial manipulating image pixels gave link website explain everything imageprocessing, much heavier topic working pixels, even swift objective-c knowledge language wasnt stated course prerequisite."
,final assignment quite vague requirements needed instructor.
,would prefered interaction instructors assignment atleast.
,"im one complaining issue, check discussion course."
,guess im fortunate already studied courses external sources started here.
,one instructors speaks quite fast alot anxiety making quite difficult understand without repeating video.
,"think actually designed someone wants learn swift xcode, rather people already solid understanding swift object oriented programming want build picture filtering application."
,perhaps stuff want learn covered later series.
,"however, far feel like wanted learn swift, better served going apple forums go anyway get questions answered."
,"besides that, they're using 2 year old version xcode!"
,would wait they've least updated course learning something people actually use now.
,"least way, know there's still someone around too."
,notice much action coursera forums either.
,think need look elsewhere actually want learn develop anything ios.
,"professional instructional designer, attest poorest-designed course ever seen."
,"regrettably, paid entire specialization up-front, cannot get refund even coursera credit enrolling different specialization."
,aware faculty instructor record participate course.
,"video lectures poorly done, including errors misstatements could edited out, appears one bothered edit raw footage uploading it."
,much instruction overview.
,"coding exercises final assignment, poorly-described requires student self-teach using outside sources."
,app specializations coursera appear much better-designed.
,look elsewhere.
,unfortunately course well thought out.
,"lecture videos poorly organized, concepts presented proper context lack sufficient detail/depth, little thought effort put designing examples videos, actual coding exercises last week, examples elegant code, thoughtful examples good vs. bad code, quizzes contain questions poorly worded ambiguous (and think actually wrong answers contradicted online resources)."
,"high level, hand-wave important concepts."
,really see class actually teach build robust high-quality app.
,probably better reading official documentation online.
,course content: swift specific topics shortly covered videos.
,"overall, teaching material short."
,"first week, students basically learn start xcode."
,"week four contains 15 minutes video image processing, that's basically week."
,follow-up readings week two provide link apple's ios developer site.
,that's clearly enough course.
,students google tutorials themselves.
,"project: projects mentions classes, covered course."
,"also impression peer reviews, students without prior knowledge lost."
,many great tutorials web offer insights give students much fundamental knowledge course.
,first expected something deeper.
,"first courser less understandable ""the swift programming language"" free book apple."
,join course read chapters point view book explains material much much better.
,"second point ??looks like tutors invent examples lesson (on fly), bring mess."
,last thing course tutors commit gross error lecture.
,"please look ""advanced swift"" lecture, talking closures."
,"teacher said closure captures copy outside variable, completely wrong!"
,"closures capture variable itself, variable value"
,i'm professional ios developer remember years ago taking first ios course terrible experience.
,clowns literally teach single thing messing around image customization playground.
,teach basic swift fundamentals (which tried 1 video like 10 minutes also terrible).
,ashamed material weak instructors even remotely motivated based monotonous tone.
,waste time go udemy take angela yu's course instead nonsense.
,"small introduction swift, last assignment expects rather fluent programming using swift."
,lot self study using guides provided apple sources needed successfully complete course.
,"furthermore video's indicate lack preparedness part instructors lot sentences cut halfway , started new new goal."
,makes course hard understand.
,"free passable, payed would sincerely regret part 2 better, still changing thoughts midway sentence"
,course waste time money.
,"i'm experienced programmer, thought would good introduction swift; wasn't."
,"first two weeks short, introductory programming lessons."
,"week 3, ""advanced swift,"" consisted one 12-minute video barely scratches surface three separate topics."
,"many things would consider fundamentals type programming course (classes, example) rarely even mentioned, much less taught demonstrated."
,"want learn swift, look elsewhere."
,waste time money course.
,"basic all, beginner programming language, going get anything installation video."
,"good someone knows least another programming language, somebody starting, all."
,"explain 6mins video 3 topics explain 3 separate dedicated videos, say go apple developer website continue learning, feel like learn everything course, thanks!"
